## What are Direct and Regular Plans?

**Direct Plans** are mutual fund schemes where investors buy units directly from the fund house without involving any intermediary or distributor. There are no distribution commissions or intermediary fees.

**Regular Plans** are mutual fund schemes where investors buy units through intermediaries like brokers, financial advisors, or distribution platforms. These intermediaries receive distribution commissions for their services.

### Key Differences Summary:

| Aspect | Direct Plan | Regular Plan |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Purchase Method** | Direct from fund house | Through intermediary |
| **Distribution Commission** | None | 0.5-1.0% annually |
| **Expense Ratio** | Lower (1.0-1.5%) | Higher (1.8-2.5%) |
| **Investor Profile** | Self-directed | Advisor-dependent |
| **Decision Making** | Investor's own research | Advisor's recommendations |

## How Distribution Commissions Work

### Regular Plan Commission Structure

#### **Upfront Commission**:
- **One-time payment** to distributor at the time of investment
- **Typical Range**: 0.5-1.0% of investment amount
- **Purpose**: Compensation for bringing new business

#### **Trailing Commission**:
- **Annual payment** to maintain relationship with investor
- **Typical Range**: 0.5-1.0% of AUM annually
- **Payment Frequency**: Usually quarterly or semi-annually
- **Duration**: As long as investor remains invested

#### **Commission Calculation Example**:
```
Investment: ₹10 lakh in Regular Plan
Upfront Commission: 0.8% = ₹8,000
Trailing Commission: 0.8% annually = ₹8,000 per year

Total Commission Over 10 Years:
- Upfront: ₹8,000
- Trailing: ₹8,000 × 10 = ₹80,000
- Total: ₹88,000

This ₹88,000 comes out of investor's returns
```

### Direct Plan - No Commission

#### **Cost Structure**:
```
Investment: ₹10 lakh in Direct Plan
Upfront Commission: ₹0
Trailing Commission: ₹0
Fund Expenses: Only management and administrative costs

Total Costs Over 10 Years:
- Fund Expenses: ~₹15,000-25,000
- No Distribution Costs
```
