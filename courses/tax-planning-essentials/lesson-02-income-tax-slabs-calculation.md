## Understanding Income Tax Slabs

### What are Income Tax Slabs?
Income tax slabs are progressive tax rate structures where higher income levels are taxed at higher rates. This ensures that people with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income as tax.

### Progressive Tax Principle
- **Fair distribution**: Higher earners pay higher tax rates
- **Social responsibility**: Wealth redistribution
- **Economic growth**: Lower burden on lower-income groups
- **Government revenue**: Sustainable revenue generation

### Benefits of Progressive Taxation
- **Income equality**: Reduces income inequality
- **Social welfare**: Funds for social programs
- **Economic stability**: Stable government revenue
- **Fair taxation**: Based on ability to pay
