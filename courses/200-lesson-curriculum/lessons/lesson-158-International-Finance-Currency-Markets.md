## Exchange Rate Theory and Analysis

### Exchange Rate Determination

#### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
**Absolute PPP**:
```
S = P_domestic / P_foreign
where S = Exchange rate, P = Price levels
```

**Relative PPP**:
```
(S_t - S_0) / S_0 = π_domestic - π_foreign
where π = Inflation rates
```

**PPP Applications**:
- **Fair Value**: Long-term exchange rate equilibrium
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Real exchange rate calculation
- **Cross-Country Comparison**: International price comparisons
- **Currency Valuation**: Over/undervalued currency assessment

**Example Calculation**:
```
US Inflation: 2.5% annually
India Inflation: 6% annually
Current USD/INR: 83.00

Relative PPP Formula:
Expected Change = (6% - 2.5%) = 3.5%
Expected Rate = 83.00 × (1 + 0.035) = 85.91
```

#### Interest Rate Parity (IRP)
**Covered Interest Rate Parity**:
```
F = S × (1 + i_domestic) / (1 + i_foreign)
where F = Forward rate, S = Spot rate, i = Interest rates
```

**Uncovered Interest Rate Parity**:
```
E(S) = S × (1 + i_domestic) / (1 + i_foreign)
where E(S) = Expected future spot rate
```

**IRP Trading Strategy**:
- **Carry Trade**: Borrow low-yield, invest in high-yield currency
- **Forward Contracts**: Lock in forward rates for risk management
- **Interest Rate Differentials**: Exploit yield spreads
- **Currency Hedging**: Manage foreign exchange exposure

#### Balance of Payments Theory
**Current Account**:
- **Trade Balance**: Exports minus imports
- **Services Balance**: Service exports minus imports
- **Income Balance**: Investment income flows
- **Transfers**: Unilateral transfers

**Capital Account**:
