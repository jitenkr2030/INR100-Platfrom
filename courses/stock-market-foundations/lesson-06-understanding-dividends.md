## What are Dividends?

**Dividends** are cash payments or additional shares that companies distribute to their shareholders from their profits. It's a way for companies to share their success with investors who own their stock.

### Why Do Companies Pay Dividends?

#### 1. **Return to Shareholders**
- Shareholders invest money expecting returns
- Dividends provide regular income
- Alternative to waiting for stock price appreciation

#### 2. **Signal Company Health**
- Regular dividends indicate stable profits
- Dividend growth shows improving fundamentals
- Consistent payments build investor confidence

#### 3. **Attract Different Investor Types**
- Income-focused investors (retirees, pension funds)
- Dividend investors seeking regular cash flow
- Conservative investors prefer dividend stocks

#### 4. **Discipline on Management**
- Regular dividend payments require good cash management
- Prevents management from wasting excess cash
- Encourages efficient capital allocation

## Types of Dividends

### 1. **Cash Dividends**

#### **Regular Cash Dividend**
- **Frequency**: Usually quarterly or annually
- **Amount**: Fixed amount per share (e.g., ₹5 per share)
- **Payment**: Direct credit to bank account
- **Example**: TCS pays ₹10 per share annually

#### **Interim Dividend**
- **Timing**: Between annual general meetings
- **Purpose**: Distribute excess cash before year-end
- **Amount**: Usually smaller than final dividend
- **Example**: Companies declare ₹3 interim + ₹7 final dividend

### 2. **Stock Dividends (Bonus Shares)**

#### **What are Bonus Shares?**
- **Definition**: Additional shares given to existing shareholders
- **Ratio**: Usually 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 (bonus:existing)
- **No Cash Outflow**: Company doesn't pay cash
- **Example**: 1:1 bonus means you get 1 free share for every 1 share held

#### **Benefits of Bonus Shares:**
- **Increase Shareholding**: More shares without investment
- **Improve Liquidity**: More shares available for trading
- **No Tax Implications**: Not taxable at the time of receipt
- **Price Adjustment**: Stock price adjusts proportionally

#### **Example: Bonus Issue**
```
Before Bonus:
- Shares Held: 100
- Share Price: ₹1,000
- Total Value: ₹1,00,000

After 1:1 Bonus:
- Shares Held: 200
- Share Price: ₹500 (adjusted)
- Total Value: ₹1,00,000 (same value)
```

### 3. **Special Dividends**

#### **One-time Dividends**
- **Trigger**: Exceptional profits or asset sales
- **Amount**: Usually larger than regular dividends
- **Infrequency**: Not expected to repeat regularly
- **Example**: Company selling a business unit pays special dividend

## Dividend Terminology

### 1. **Dividend Yield**
- **Formula**: (Annual Dividend per Share / Share Price) × 100
- **Example**: Stock price ₹1,000, annual dividend ₹50 → 5% yield
- **Interpretation**: Annual return from dividends

### 2. **Dividend Payout Ratio**
- **Formula**: (Total Dividends / Net Income) × 100
- **Example**: Net income ₹100 crore, dividends ₹30 crore → 30% payout
- **Significance**: How much of profits are distributed

### 3. **Dividend Coverage Ratio**
- **Formula**: Net Income / Total Dividends
- **Example**: Net income ₹100 crore, dividends ₹30 crore → 3.33x coverage
- **Safety**: Higher ratio means more sustainable dividends

### 4. **Ex-Dividend Date**
- **Definition**: Date from which stock trades without dividend entitlement
- **Important**: Must own shares before this date to receive dividend
- **Example**: Ex-dividend date is April 15, buy on April 14 to receive dividend

## How Dividends Work in Practice

### Dividend Process Timeline:

#### **1. Announcement**
- **Board Meeting**: Directors approve dividend proposal
- **Announcement**: Company announces dividend amount and dates
- **Record Date**: Shareholders on this date are eligible
- **Ex-Dividend Date**: Usually 1-2 days before record date

#### **2. Trading Adjustment**
- **Price Adjustment**: Stock price drops by dividend amount on ex-date
- **Market Correction**: Reflects cash outflow from company
- **Total Value**: Shareholder's total value remains same

#### **3. Payment**
- **Timeline**: Usually 30-45 days after announcement
- **Payment Methods**: 
  - Direct bank credit
  - Dividend warrants (cheques)
  - Electronic transfer

### Real Example: **HDFC Bank Dividend**

#### **2024 Dividend:**
- **Announcement**: ₹19.50 per share (annual)
- **Record Date**: June 15, 2024
- **Ex-Dividend Date**: June 13, 2024
- **Payment**: July 20, 2024
- **Yield**: ~3.8% at current price

#### **Investor Impact:**
```
Holding: 100 HDFC Bank shares
Dividend Received: ₹1,950 (100 × ₹19.50)
Annual Yield: ~3.8%
Compared to FD: Higher than most bank fixed deposits
```

## Dividend Aristocrats and Kings
