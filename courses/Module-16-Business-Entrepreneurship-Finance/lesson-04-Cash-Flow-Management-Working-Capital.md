**Quality Indicators**:
```
Cash Flow Quality Metrics:
Operating Cash Flow / Net Income > 1.0
Operating Cash Flow / Revenue > 8%
Days Sales Outstanding: Stable or improving
Inventory Turnover: Stable or improving
```

#### Cash Conversion Analysis
**Cash Conversion Efficiency**:
```
Cash Conversion Formula:
Cash Conversion = (Operating Cash Flow / Revenue) × 365

Industry Benchmarks:
Manufacturing: 30-60 days
Retail: 15-30 days
Software: 45-90 days
Services: 20-45 days
```

Increase in AP: ₹10 crores
Increase in Accrued Expenses: ₹5 crores

Operating Cash Flow: ₹117 crores
```

### Free Cash Flow Analysis

#### Free Cash Flow Calculation
**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**:
```
FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

Detailed Calculation:
Operating Cash Flow: ₹117 crores
Less: Capital Expenditures: ₹75 crores
Free Cash Flow: ₹42 crores

FCF Yield = FCF / Enterprise Value
FCF Yield = ₹42 / ₹500 = 8.4%
```

**Free Cash Flow Variations**:
```
FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm):
FCFF = Operating Cash Flow - Capex + Interest × (1 - Tax Rate)

FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity):
FCFE = FCFF - Debt Repayments + New Debt
```

#### FCF Valuation
**Terminal Value Calculation**:
```
FCF Growth Model:
Terminal FCF = FCF₀ × (1 + g)
Terminal Value = Terminal FCF / (WACC - g)

Example:
Year 5 FCF: ₹60 crores
Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
WACC: 10%

Terminal Value = ₹60 × 1.03 / (0.10 - 0.03) = ₹885 crores
```

Quick Ratio = (200 - 80) / 120 = 1.0

Quick Assets: ₹120 crores
Analysis: Adequate liquidity excluding inventory
```

### Working Capital Optimization

#### Efficiency Metrics
**Working Capital Turnover**:
```
Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / Average Working Capital

Calculation:
Revenue: ₹1,000 crores
Average Working Capital: ₹75 crores
Turnover: 13.33x

Higher turnover indicates better efficiency
```

**Days Working Capital**:
```
Days Working Capital = 365 / Working Capital Turnover

#### Inventory Valuation Methods
**First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**:
```
FIFO Example:
Beginning Inventory: 100 units @ ₹10 = ₹1,000
Purchase 1: 100 units @ ₹12 = ₹1,200
Purchase 2: 100 units @ ₹15 = ₹1,500
Sales: 200 units

Cost of Goods Sold:
100 units @ ₹10 = ₹1,000
100 units @ ₹12 = ₹1,200
Total COGS: ₹2,200

Ending Inventory:
100 units @ ₹15 = ₹1,500
```

**Weighted Average Cost**:
```
Weighted Average Calculation:
Total Cost: ₹1,000 + ₹1,200 + ₹1,500 = ₹3,700
Total Units: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
Weighted Average Cost: ₹3,700 / 300 = ₹12.33

Cost of Goods Sold (200 units):
200 × ₹12.33 = ₹2,466

Ending Inventory (100 units):
100 × ₹12.33 = ₹1,233
```

### Inventory Control Systems

#### ABC Analysis
**Classification Criteria**:
```
ABC Analysis:
A Items (High Value):
├── 20% of items
├── 80% of value
├── Frequent monitoring
├── Tight control
└── Economic order quantities

B Items (Medium Value):
├── 30% of items
├── 15% of value
├── Regular monitoring
├── Standard controls
└── Reorder point system

C Items (Low Value):
├── 50% of items
├── 5% of value
├── Periodic monitoring
├── Simple controls
└── Bulk ordering
```

#### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
**EOQ Formula**:
```
EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost / Holding Cost)

Example:
Annual Demand: 10,000 units
Ordering Cost: ₹500 per order
Holding Cost: ₹2 per unit per year

EOQ = √(2 × 10,000 × 500 / 2) = √(5,000,000) = 2,236 units

Optimal Orders per Year: 10,000 / 2,236 = 4.47 orders
```

#### Reorder Point System
**Reorder Point Formula**:
```
Reorder Point = Lead Time Demand + Safety Stock

Components:
Lead Time: 15 days
Daily Demand: 50 units
Lead Time Demand: 15 × 50 = 750 units
Safety Stock: 100 units

Reorder Point: 750 + 100 = 850 units
```

### Inventory Performance Metrics

#### Inventory Turnover
**Calculation and Analysis**:
```
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Example:
COGS: ₹600 crores
Beginning Inventory: ₹65 crores
Ending Inventory: ₹80 crores
Average Inventory: ₹72.5 crores

Inventory Turnover: ₹600 / ₹72.5 = 8.28 times

Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):
DIO = 365 / Inventory Turnover = 365 / 8.28 = 44 days
