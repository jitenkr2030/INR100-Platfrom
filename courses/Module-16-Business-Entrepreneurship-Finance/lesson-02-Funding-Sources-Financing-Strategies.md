## Capital Structure Optimization

### Cost of Capital Analysis

#### Cost of Equity
**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**:
```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium

Example:
Risk-Free Rate: 6.5%
Beta: 1.2
Market Risk Premium: 8%
Cost of Equity = 6.5% + 1.2 × 8% = 16.1%
```

**Dividend Growth Model**:
```
Cost of Equity = (Dividend per Share / Current Stock Price) + Growth Rate

Example:
Dividend per Share: ₹5
Current Stock Price: ₹100
Growth Rate: 10%
Cost of Equity = (₹5/₹100) + 10% = 15%
```

#### Cost of Debt
**Before-Tax Cost of Debt**:
```
Bank Loan:
Principal: ₹1,00,00,000
Annual Interest: ₹12,00,000
Interest Rate = ₹12,00,000 / ₹1,00,00,000 = 12%

Bond Issue:
Face Value: ₹100
Coupon Rate: 8%
Current Price: ₹95
Yield to Maturity: ~8.7%
```

**After-Tax Cost of Debt**:
```
After-Tax Cost = Before-Tax Cost × (1 - Tax Rate)

Example:
Before-Tax Cost: 12%
Tax Rate: 25%
After-Tax Cost = 12% × (1 - 0.25) = 9%
```

#### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
**Formula**:
```
WACC = (E/V) × Re + (D/V) × Rd × (1 - Tax Rate)

Where:
E = Market value of equity
D = Market value of debt
V = E + D (Total value)
Re = Cost of equity
Rd = Cost of debt
```

**WACC Calculation Example**:
```
Company XYZ:
Market Value of Equity: ₹80,00,00,000
Market Value of Debt: ₹20,00,00,000
Total Value: ₹1,00,00,00,000

Cost of Equity: 16.1%
Cost of Debt: 9%
Tax Rate: 25%

WACC = (80/100) × 16.1% + (20/100) × 9% × (1 - 0.25)
WACC = 12.88% + 1.35% = 14.23%
```

### Optimal Capital Structure

#### Trade-off Theory
**Factors to Consider**:
- Tax benefits of debt
- Financial distress costs
- Agency costs
- Market timing considerations

**Optimal Debt Level**:

#### Pecking Order Theory

2. Debt financing
3. Equity financing

**Implementation**:
- Prioritize internal funding sources
- Use debt before equity when possible
- Maintain financial flexibility
- Consider signaling effects

### Capital Structure Decisions

#### Leverage Analysis
**Leverage Ratios**:
```
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
Debt-to-Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets
Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense

Benchmark Comparisons:
Industry Average D/E: 0.8
Target D/E Range: 0.6 - 1.0
Minimum Interest Coverage: 3.0x
```

**Financial Flexibility Assessment**:
- Credit rating maintenance
