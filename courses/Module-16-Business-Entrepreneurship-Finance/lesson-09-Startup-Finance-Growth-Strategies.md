## Financial Metrics and KPIs

### Revenue Metrics

#### Recurring Revenue Models
**Subscription Metrics**:
```
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):
MRR Calculation:
New MRR: New subscribers × Average price
Expansion MRR: Existing customers × Price increase
Churned MRR: Lost subscribers × Average price
Net New MRR: New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR

Example:
New Customers: 100 × ₹1,000 = ₹1,00,000
Expansion: 50 × ₹500 = ₹25,000
Churn: 20 × ₹1,000 = -₹20,000
Net New MRR: ₹1,00,000 + ₹25,000 - ₹20,000 = ₹1,05,000
```

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**:
```
ARR Calculation:
ARR = MRR × 12

Growth Metrics:
Month-over-Month Growth: (Current MRR - Previous MRR) / Previous MRR × 100
Year-over-Year Growth: (Current ARR - Previous ARR) / Previous ARR × 100
```

#### Customer Acquisition and Retention
**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
```
CAC Formula:
CAC = Total Sales and Marketing Expenses / Number of New Customers

CAC Components:
├── Marketing campaigns
├── Sales team costs
├── Software and tools
├── Events and conferences
└── Agency fees

Example Calculation:
Monthly Marketing: ₹5,00,000
Sales Team: ₹3,00,000
Tools and Software: ₹1,00,000
Total Expenses: ₹9,00,000
New Customers: 300
CAC = ₹9,00,000 / 300 = ₹3,000
```

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
```
LTV Calculation:
LTV = Average Revenue per Customer × Customer Lifespan

Detailed LTV:
LTV = (Average Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

Example:
Average Monthly Revenue: ₹1,000
Gross Margin: 80%
Churn Rate: 5% monthly
Customer Lifespan: 1 / 0.05 = 20 months
LTV = (₹1,000 × 0.80) / 0.05 = ₹16,000
```

**LTV/CAC Ratio**:
```
LTV/CAC Analysis:
LTV: ₹16,000
CAC: ₹3,000
LTV/CAC Ratio: 16,000 / 3,000 = 5.33

Interpretation:
├── LTV/CAC > 3: Healthy ratio
├── LTV/CAC = 3: Break-even point
├── LTV/CAC < 3: Unprofitable
└── Target: 4-6 for sustainable growth
```

### Growth and Engagement Metrics

#### Growth Metrics
**Monthly Active Users (MAU)**:
```
MAU Calculation:
Active Users: Users who performed key action within 30 days
Key Actions: Login, transaction, content consumption
Retention: Users who remain active over time

Growth Rate:
MAU Growth = (Current MAU - Previous MAU) / Previous MAU × 100
```

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**:
```
NRR Formula:
NRR = (Beginning MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Beginning MRR × 100

Components:
Beginning MRR: Starting month's recurring revenue
Expansion: Upsells and cross-sells
Contraction: Downgrades
Churn: Customer losses

Example:
Beginning MRR: ₹10,00,000
Expansion: ₹1,50,000
Contraction: -₹50,000
Churn: -₹1,00,000
NRR = (10,00,000 + 1,50,000 - 50,000 - 1,00,000) / 10,00,000 × 100 = 100%
```

#### Engagement Metrics
**Churn Rate**:
```
Churn Rate Calculation:
Customer Churn Rate: (Customers Lost / Total Customers at Start) × 100
Revenue Churn Rate: (MRR Lost / Total MRR at Start) × 100

Monthly Churn Rate:
Customers Lost: 50
Beginning Customers: 1,000
Monthly Churn Rate = 50 / 1,000 × 100 = 5%
```

**Cohort Analysis**:
```
Cohort Analysis:
Track customer groups over time:
Month 1 Cohort:
├── Month 1: 100 customers
├── Month 2: 95 customers (5% churn)
├── Month 3: 90 customers (10% cumulative churn)
├── Month 4: 85 customers (15% cumulative churn)
└── Month 5: 82 customers (18% cumulative churn)
```

### Financial Health Metrics

#### Burn Rate and Runway
**Monthly Burn Rate**:
```
Burn Rate Calculation:
Net Burn Rate = Cash Outflows - Cash Inflows
Gross Burn Rate = Total Monthly Expenses

Example:
Monthly Revenue: ₹5,00,000
Monthly Expenses: ₹15,00,000
Net Burn Rate: ₹15,00,000 - ₹5,00,000 = ₹10,00,000

Runway Calculation:
Runway = Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate
Cash Balance: ₹50,00,000
Runway = ₹50,00,000 / ₹10,00,000 = 5 months
```

**Cash Efficiency**:
```
Cash Efficiency Metrics:
Revenue Multiple: Revenue / Cash Burn
Magic Number: (Quarterly Revenue Growth × Gross Margin) / Cash Burn
Payback Period: CAC / Monthly LTV per Customer
```

#### Unit Economics
**Unit Economics Framework**:
