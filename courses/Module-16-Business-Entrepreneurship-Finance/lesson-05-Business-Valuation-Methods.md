## Income-Based Valuation Methods

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method

#### DCF Fundamentals
**Basic Formula**:
```
Enterprise Value = Σ [FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^t] + Terminal Value

Where:
FCF(t) = Free Cash Flow in year t
WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital
Terminal Value = FCF(n+1) / (WACC - g)
```

#### Free Cash Flow Calculation
**Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**:
```
FCFF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Capex - ΔWorking Capital

Detailed Calculation:
Net Income: ₹100 crores
Add: Interest Expense: ₹20 crores
Add: Tax on Interest: ₹5 crores (25% tax rate)
EBIT: ₹125 crores
Tax on EBIT: ₹31.25 crores
NOPAT: ₹93.75 crores

Add: Depreciation: ₹30 crores
Less: Capex: ₹40 crores
Less: Increase in Working Capital: ₹15 crores
FCFF: ₹68.75 crores
```

#### Terminal Value Calculation
**Gordon Growth Model**:
```
Terminal Value = FCFF(n+1) / (WACC - g)

Where:
FCFF(n+1) = FCFF(n) × (1 + g)
g = Perpetual growth rate

Example:
Year 5 FCFF: ₹100 crores
Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
WACC: 10%
Terminal Value = ₹100 × 1.03 / (0.10 - 0.03) = ₹1,471 crores
```

**Exit Multiple Method**:
```
Terminal Value = EBITDA(n+1) × Exit Multiple

Example:
Year 5 EBITDA: ₹120 crores
Exit Multiple: 10x
Terminal Value: ₹1,200 crores
```

### Capitalized Earnings Method

#### Methodology
**Formula**:
```
Value = Normalized Earnings / Capitalization Rate

Where:
Capitalization Rate = Discount Rate - Growth Rate
```

#### Application Example
**Business Profile**:
```
Business Metrics:
Normalized Net Income: ₹50 crores
Discount Rate: 12%
Long-term Growth Rate: 3%

Capitalization Rate = 12% - 3% = 9%
Business Value = ₹50 / 0.09 = ₹556 crores
```

#### Multi-Period Excess Earnings
**Methodology for Intangible Assets**:
```
Excess Earnings = Total Earnings - (Return on Net Tangible Assets + Return on Identifiable Intangible Assets)

Intangible Asset Value = Excess Earnings / Capitalization Rate
```

### Adjusted Present Value (APV) Method

#### APV Components
**Formula**:
```
APV = NPV of Project if All-Equity Financed + NPV of Financing Effects

Components:
NPV of All-Equity Project:
├── Present value of operating cash flows
├── Terminal value calculation
└── Discount at unlevered cost of equity

NPV of Financing Effects:
├── Tax shield from debt
├── flotation costs
├── financial distress costs
└── other financing costs
```

#### Tax Shield Calculation
**Annual Tax Shield**:
```
Tax Shield = Interest Expense × Tax Rate

Example:
Debt: ₹200 crores
Interest Rate: 8%
Interest Expense: ₹16 crores
Tax Rate: 25%
Annual Tax Shield: ₹4 crores

Present Value of Tax Shield:
If debt is perpetual: ₹4 / 0.08 = ₹50 crores
If debt matures in 10 years: PV of annuity = ₹26.9 crores
```

## Market-Based Valuation Techniques

Company B: EV/EBITDA = 10x, P/E = 15x
Company C: EV/EBITDA = 14x, P/E = 20x

Industry Averages:
EV/EBITDA: 12x
P/E: 17.7x

Target Company:
EBITDA: ₹100 crores
Net Income: ₹50 crores
Shares Outstanding: 10 crores

Valuation:
EV/EBITDA: ₹100 × 12 = ₹1,200 crores

Transaction Value: ₹900 crores
Control Premium: 25%
Synergy Value: ₹100 crores

Analysis:
Minority Value = ₹900 / 1.25 = ₹720 crores
Synergy Value = ₹100 crores
Base Business Value = ₹720 - ₹100 = ₹620 crores
Transaction Multiple: ₹900 / ₹75 = 12x EBITDA
```

Gross Margin: 80%

Revenue Multiples:
High Growth (100%+): 12-20x ARR
Moderate Growth (50-100%): 8-15x ARR
Stable Growth (25-50%): 5-10x ARR

Valuation Range:
Conservative: ₹50 × 8 = ₹400 crores
Moderate: ₹50 × 12 = ₹600 crores
Aggressive: ₹50 × 16 = ₹800 crores
```

#### Rule of 40
**Growth and Profitability Balance**:
```
Rule of 40: Growth Rate + Profit Margin > 40%

Company Analysis:
Revenue Growth: 100%
EBITDA Margin: -10%
Rule of 40 Score: 90

Interpretation:
Score > 40: Healthy growth profile
Score 20-40: Moderate performance
Score < 20: Concerning performance
```

### Mature Business Valuation

#### Income-Based Focus
**Established Company Methods**:
```
DCF Analysis for Mature Business:
Stable FCF: ₹50 crores
Terminal Growth: 2%
WACC: 9%

Terminal Value = ₹50 × 1.02 / (0.09 - 0.02) = ₹734 crores

Discounted Value (assuming 5-year projection):
PV of Terminal Value: ₹734 / (1.09)^5 = ₹478 crores
PV of Explicit Period: ₹150 crores
Enterprise Value: ₹628 crores
```

#### Dividend Discount Model
**For Mature, Dividend-Paying Companies**:
```
Dividend Discount Model:
Value = D1 / (r - g)

Where:
D1 = Next year's dividend
r = Required return
g = Dividend growth rate

Example:
Expected Dividend: ₹5 per share
Required Return: 12%
Growth Rate: 6%
Value = ₹5 / (0.12 - 0.06) = ₹83.33 per share
```
