## What is a Ponzi Scheme?

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where returns are paid to earlier investors using the capital from newer investors, rather than from profit earned by the operation. The scheme维持s the illusion of a legitimate business by paying out impressive returns to attract more investors.

### How Ponzi Schemes Work

#### Stage 1: The Promise
- **High returns**: Promise unusually high, consistent returns
- **Low risk**: Claim minimal risk or guaranteed returns
- **Simple process**: Easy investment with minimal requirements
- **Social proof**: Use testimonials and early success stories

#### Stage 2: The Illusion
- **Pay early investors**: Use new money to pay returns to early investors
- **Create legitimacy**: Show consistent returns and positive statements
- **Attract more money**: Use success stories to attract more investors
- **Expand rapidly**: Recruit new investors aggressively

#### Stage 3: The Collapse
- **Can't sustain**: Eventually run out of new investors
- **Returns stop**: Cannot continue paying promised returns
- **Investigations begin**: Authorities start investigating
- **Founder disappears**: Often flee with remaining money
