Money doesn't just exist—it has to be created, controlled, and managed. Understanding how the monetary system works helps you comprehend economic news, make better financial decisions, and appreciate the forces that influence inflation, interest rates, and economic growth. This lesson demystifies the complex world of money creation and circulation.

## How Money is Created

### The Banking System Structure

#### Central Bank vs Commercial Banks
**Central Bank (Reserve Bank of India)**:
- **Monopoly on Currency**: Only entity that can create physical currency
- **Banker's Bank**: Provides services to commercial banks
- **Monetary Authority**: Controls money supply and interest rates
- **Lender of Last Resort**: Provides emergency funding to banks

**Commercial Banks (Public and Private)**:
- **Accept Deposits**: Take money from customers
- **Lend Money**: Provide loans to businesses and individuals
- **Create Money**: Generate digital money through lending
- **Payment Processing**: Handle transactions and transfers

#### Banking Hierarchy in India
**Top Tier - RBI**:
- Controls monetary policy
- Issues currency notes
- Regulates other banks
- Maintains financial stability

**Second Tier - Public Sector Banks**:
- SBI, PNB, BOB, Canara Bank, etc.
- Largest network and customer base
- Government ownership
- Social banking focus

**Third Tier - Private Sector Banks**:
- HDFC, ICICI, Axis, Kotak, etc.
- Technology-driven services
- Higher efficiency and innovation
- Customer-focused approach

**Fourth Tier - Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks**:
- Local and regional focus
- Serve specific communities
- Simplified banking services
- Rural and agricultural focus

### Money Creation Process

#### Fractional Reserve Banking
**The Basic Concept**:
Banks don't keep all deposited money as cash. They lend out most of it while keeping only a fraction as reserves.

**Reserve Requirements**:
- **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**: Percentage of deposits banks must hold as cash
- **Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)**: Percentage that must be invested in government securities
- **Current CRR**: 4.50% (as of December 2025)
- **Current SLR**: 18.00%

#### Step-by-Step Money Creation Example

**Initial Deposit**: Customer A deposits ₹1,000 in Bank X

**Bank X's Actions**:
1. **Reserve Requirement**: Keep ₹45 (4.5% of ₹1,000) as cash
2. **Available for Lending**: ₹955 can be lent out
3. **Create Loan**: Lend ₹955 to Customer B

**Customer B's Actions**:
- Receives ₹955 loan
- Deposits it in Bank Y (or same bank)

**Bank Y's Actions**:
1. **Reserve Requirement**: Keep ₹43 (4.5% of ₹955) as cash
2. **Available for Lending**: ₹912 can be lent out
3. **Create New Loan**: Lend ₹912 to Customer C

**Money Multiplier Effect**:
```
Initial Deposit: ₹1,000
First Loan: ₹955
Second Loan: ₹912
Third Loan: ₹871
... continues until...
Total Money Created: ₹1,000 ÷ 0.045 = ₹22,222
```

**Key Insight**: A single ₹1,000 deposit creates over ₹22,000 in total money supply through the lending process.

### Types of Money Creation

#### 1. Central Bank Money Creation
**Physical Currency**:
- RBI prints banknotes
- Mints coins
- Distributes to commercial banks
- Banks distribute to customers

**Digital Central Bank Money**:
- **Reserve Balances**: Banks' accounts with RBI
- **Settlement Money**: Used for interbank transfers
- **Government Money**: RBI manages government accounts

#### 2. Commercial Bank Money Creation
**Demand Deposits**:
- Money in checking/savings accounts
- Created when banks make loans
- Digital money that can be transferred electronically
- Called "bank money" or "credit money"

**How It Works**:
1. Bank approves loan for ₹1,00,000
2. Creates deposit account with ₹1,00,000 balance
3. Borrower can spend this money immediately
4. Money exists as digital entry in bank's computer

#### 3. Money Multiplier Formula
**Formula**: Money Multiplier = 1 ÷ Reserve Requirement

**Example Calculation**:
- Reserve Requirement: 4.5%
- Money Multiplier = 1 ÷ 0.045 = 22.22
- ₹1,000 base money creates ₹22,220 total money

**Actual Multiplier in India**: Typically 10-12 due to:
- Banks holding excess reserves
- Some cash leakage (people withdrawing cash)
- Regulatory requirements

### Money Supply Measurements

#### M1 Money Supply
**Components**:
- **Currency with Public**: Cash in people's hands
- **Demand Deposits**: Money in checking accounts
- **Other Deposits**: Certain savings accounts

**Characteristics**:
- Most liquid money
- Immediately spendable
- Includes cash and checking accounts
- Measured by RBI monthly

#### M2 Money Supply
**Components**:
- **M1 Money Supply**
- **Time Deposits**: Savings accounts and fixed deposits
- **Post Office Savings**: National Savings Certificate, etc.

**Characteristics**:
- Less liquid than M1
- Includes savings and term deposits
- Still considered money supply
- Measured by RBI

#### M3 Money Supply
**Components**:
- **M2 Money Supply**
- **Bank Deposits**: Time deposits of all banks
- **Deposits with Post Office**: All post office savings

**Characteristics**:
- Broadest measure of money
- Includes all bank deposits
- Used for monetary policy
- Historical measure (less emphasized now)

#### M4 Money Supply
**Components**:
- **M3 Money Supply**
- **Total Deposits**: All deposits with non-banking institutions
- **Marketable Instruments**: Money market instruments

**Characteristics**:
- Most comprehensive measure
- Includes shadow banking
- Complex to measure
- Not widely used for policy

### Current Indian Money Supply (2025)

#### Money Supply Statistics
**M1 Growth**:
- Current level: ₹50+ trillion
- Annual growth rate: 8-10%
- Driven by digital payments and banking inclusion

**Key Trends**:
- **Cash Ratio Declining**: Cash as percentage of M1 decreasing
- **Deposit Growth**: Savings and term deposits growing
- **Digital Banking**: UPI and digital wallets increasing money velocity
- **Rural Penetration**: Banking inclusion expanding money supply

#### Money Velocity
**Definition**: How quickly money circulates through the economy

**Formula**: Velocity = GDP ÷ Money Supply

**Indian Context**:
- **Current Velocity**: ~1.2-1.5 (money changes hands 1.2-1.5 times per year)
- **Global Comparison**: Lower than developed countries (2-3)
- **Impact**: Lower velocity means money supply growth doesn't immediately increase GDP

## The Role of Central Banks

- **Economic Activity Increases**: More spending and investment

**Example - 2020 COVID Response**:
- Repo rate cut from 5.15% to 4.00%
- CRR reduced from 4% to 3%
- Special liquidity facility of ₹1 trillion
- Result: Significant increase in money supply

#### Contractionary Monetary Policy
**When to Use**: High inflation, economic overheating, asset bubbles

**Policy Actions**:
1. **Raise Repo Rate**: Increase borrowing costs for banks
2. **Increase CRR**: Banks must hold more reserves
3. **Increase SLR**: Reduce funds available for lending
4. **Sell Securities**: Remove money from circulation

**Economic Impact**:

## Money Circulation and Economic Impact

### How Money Moves Through Economy

#### Money Circulation Cycle
**Step 1: Money Creation**
- RBI creates base money (cash and reserves)
- Commercial banks create deposit money through lending

**Step 2: Economic Activity**
- Businesses receive payments for goods/services
- Employees receive wages and salaries
- Government receives taxes and spends money

**Step 3: Money Returns to Banks**
- Deposits created from economic activity
- Banks can lend again, creating more money
- Cycle continues, multiplying money supply

#### Real Economy Example
**Scenario**: Construction Company Gets Loan

1. **Bank Approval**: Bank X approves ₹10 crore loan to ABC Construction
2. **Account Creation**: ABC Construction gets ₹10 crore in bank account
3. **Supplier Payments**: ABC pays ₹5 crore to cement supplier, ₹3 crore to steel supplier
4. **Employee Salaries**: ABC pays ₹1 crore salaries to workers
5. **Tax Payments**: ABC pays ₹50 lakhs in taxes
6. **Bank Deposits**: Suppliers, workers, government deposit money back in banks
7. **New Lending**: Banks have new deposits to lend again

**Money Impact**: ₹10 crore initial loan creates economic activity worth ₹10 crore + additional economic multiplier effects

### Economic Indicators Related to Money

#### Inflation Rate
**Definition**: Rate at which prices of goods and services increase over time

**Types of Inflation**:
- **Cost-Push Inflation**: Caused by increase in production costs

### Money Supply and Economic Activity

#### Relationship Between Money and GDP
**The Quantity Theory of Money**:
**Formula**: MV = PY
Where:
- M = Money Supply
- V = Velocity of Money
- P = Price Level
- Y = Real GDP

**Interpretation**:

- **Credit Support**: Ensure banks can lend

**Impact on Money**:
- Money velocity decreases (people hold money)
- Credit growth slows
- Money supply growth may not translate to economic growth
- Deflationary pressures emerge

#### Economic Expansion
**Characteristics**:
- High economic growth
- Low unemployment
- Rising inflation
- Strong business and consumer confidence

**Monetary Policy Response**:
- **Raise Interest Rates**: Prevent overheating
- **Slow Money Supply Growth**: Control inflation
- **Reduce Liquidity**: Remove excess money from system
- **Tighten Credit**: Restrict lending

**Impact on Money**:
- Money velocity increases (more spending)
- Credit growth accelerates
