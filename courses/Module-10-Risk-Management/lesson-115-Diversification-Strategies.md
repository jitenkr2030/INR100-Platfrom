- Monitor and rebalance diversified portfolios effectively

## The Foundation of Diversification

### "Don't Put All Eggs in One Basket"

Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk. The core principle is that different investments don't always move together, so losses in some can be offset by gains in others.

### Why Diversification Works

#### Risk Reduction
- **Individual Risk**: Risk of any single investment failing
- **Systematic Risk**: Risk affecting entire market
- **Diversification Effect**: Reducing overall portfolio risk
- **Correlation Benefit**: Different assets move differently

#### Mathematical Foundation
- **Portfolio Risk**: Less than weighted average of individual risks
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Measures how assets move together
- **Diversification Benefit**: Maximum when assets have low correlation

### Simple Diversification Example

#### Single Investment
- **Stock A**: 50% chance of +20%, 50% chance of -10%
- **Expected Return**: 5%
- **Risk**: High volatility, potential -10% loss

#### Two Perfectly Correlated Investments
- **Stock A + Stock B**: Both move exactly the same
- **Expected Return**: 5%
- **Risk**: Same as single investment, no benefit

#### Two Uncorrelated Investments
- **Stock A**: 50% chance of +20%, 50% chance of -10%
- **Stock B**: 50% chance of +10%, 50% chance of -5%
- **Portfolio**: Can have +15%, +7.5%, +2.5%, or -7.5%
- **Risk**: Significantly lower than single investment

## Types of Diversification

### Diversification Benefit Calculation

#### Portfolio Standard Deviation Formula
**σp = √(w1²σ1² + w2²σ2² + 2w1w2σ1σ2ρ12)**

Where:
- σp = Portfolio standard deviation
- w1, w2 = Weights of assets 1 and 2
- σ1, σ2 = Standard deviations of assets 1 and 2
- ρ12 = Correlation coefficient

#### Example Calculation

**Asset A (Equity Fund):**
- **Weight**: 60%
- **Std Dev**: 18%
- **Expected Return**: 12%

**Asset B (Debt Fund):**
- **Weight**: 40%
- **Std Dev**: 6%
- **Expected Return**: 7%

**Correlation**: 0.2

**Portfolio Std Dev**:
= √[(0.6²×18²) + (0.4²×6²) + 2×0.6×0.4×18×6×0.2]
= √[(0.36×324) + (0.16×36) + (0.96×21.6)]
= √[116.64 + 5.76 + 20.74]
= √143.14 = 11.96%

**Weighted Average**: (0.6×18) + (0.4×6) = 13.2%
**Diversification Benefit**: 13.2% - 11.96% = 1.24% risk reduction
