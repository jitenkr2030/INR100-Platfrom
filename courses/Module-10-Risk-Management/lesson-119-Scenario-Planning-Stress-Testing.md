- Analyze cash flow impact
- Evaluate goal achievement

### Step 4: Develop Response Plans
- Define trigger points for action
- Create rebalancing strategies
- Plan emergency fund usage
- Set stop-loss levels if applicable

## Scenario Analysis Tools

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Runs thousands of possible scenarios
- Uses probability distributions
- Provides success/failure probabilities
- Shows range of possible outcomes

### Historical Backtesting
- Tests strategy on past data
- Shows worst-case historical performance
- Identifies strategy strengths/weaknesses
- Provides context for expectations

### Factor Stress Testing
- Tests portfolio against specific risks
- Interest rate sensitivity
- Currency exposure analysis

## Building Resilience

### Diversification Strategy
- **Geographic Diversification**: Global exposure
- **Asset Class Diversification**: Stocks, bonds, alternatives
