Debt is one of the most misunderstood concepts in personal finance.

Understanding the difference between good debt and bad debt is crucial for making smart financial decisions and building long-term wealth.

## What is Debt?

### Basic Definition
**Debt** is money borrowed from someone else that must be repaid with interest over a specific period.

### Why Does Debt Exist?
**Debt serves several purposes**:

2. **Investment**: Provides capital for income-generating assets
3. **Education**: Funds skill development for higher earning potential
4. **Opportunity**: Enables seizing time-sensitive opportunities
5. **Emergency**: Provides funds during unexpected situations

### The Role of Debt in Economics
**For Individuals**:

- Offers liquidity during emergencies

**For Society**:
- Facilitates economic growth and development

## The Fundamental Distinction: Good Debt vs Bad Debt

### Good Debt Definition
**Good Debt** is borrowed money that:
- Generates income or appreciates in value
- Increases your net worth over time
