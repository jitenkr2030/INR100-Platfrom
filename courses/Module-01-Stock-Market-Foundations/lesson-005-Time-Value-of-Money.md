## Introduction

The Time Value of Money (TVM) is one of the most important concepts in finance. It recognizes that ₹1,000 today is worth more than ₹1,000 tomorrow because money can be invested to earn returns. This fundamental principle affects every financial decision you make—from choosing a savings account to planning your retirement. Understanding TVM will help you make smarter choices and build wealth more effectively.

## What is Time Value of Money?

### Basic Concept
**Time Value of Money (TVM)** is the idea that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future because it can be invested to earn returns.

### Why Does Money Have Time Value?

#### 1. Earning Potential
**Money can be invested**:
- ₹10,000 in a fixed deposit earning 6% becomes ₹10,600 in one year
- The extra ₹600 is compensation for waiting
- Your money grows just by sitting in the right place

#### 2. Inflation Erosion
**Purchasing power decreases**:
- ₹10,000 today can buy more than ₹10,000 next year
- Inflation reduces what money can buy
- Money loses value over time if not invested

#### 3. Risk and Uncertainty
**Future is uncertain**:
- People prefer certainty over uncertainty
- Getting money sooner is less risky
- Lenders demand compensation for risk of not getting money back

#### 4. Opportunity Cost
**Alternative uses**:
- Money used today can't be used elsewhere
- Every rupee has alternative investment opportunities
- The cost of not investing elsewhere

### Simple Example
**Scenario Comparison**:
- **Option A**: Receive ₹1,00,000 today
- **Option B**: Receive ₹1,00,000 one year from today

**Which is better?**
- Option A is better because:
  - You can invest it immediately
  - ₹1,00,000 invested at 6% becomes ₹1,06,000
  - You have extra ₹6,000 compared to Option B
  - You eliminate the risk of not receiving the money

## Key Components of Time Value

### Present Value (PV)
**Definition**: The current worth of a future sum of money given a specific rate of return.

**Simple Explanation**: How much ₹1,00,000 to be received in the future is worth today.

**Example**:
- **Future amount**: ₹1,00,000 (received 1 year from now)
- **Interest rate**: 6% per year
- **Present value**: ₹1,00,000 ÷ (1 + 0.06) = ₹94,340
- **Meaning**: ₹94,340 today is equivalent to ₹1,00,000 in one year at 6% return

### Future Value (FV)
**Definition**: The value of a current sum of money at a future date based on compound interest.

**Simple Explanation**: How much ₹1,00,000 today will be worth in the future with compound interest.

**Example**:
- **Present amount**: ₹1,00,000
- **Interest rate**: 6% per year
- **Time period**: 5 years
- **Future value**: ₹1,00,000 × (1 + 0.06)^5 = ₹1,33,823
- **Meaning**: ₹1,00,000 invested at 6% will grow to ₹1,33,823 in 5 years

### Compounding vs Discounting

#### Compounding (Going Forward)
**Process**: Money grows over time
**Formula**: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
**Example**: ₹10,000 at 8% for 3 years = ₹10,000 × (1.08)^3 = ₹12,597

#### Discounting (Going Backward)
**Process**: Future money is valued in today's terms
**Formula**: PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)^n
**Example**: ₹10,000 in 3 years at 8% discount = ₹10,000 ÷ (1.08)^3 = ₹7,938

### Interest Rates and Time

#### Annual Interest Rate
**Definition**: Interest rate expressed per year
**Examples**:
- Fixed Deposit: 6.5% per year
- PPF: 7.1% per year
- Equity: 12% per year (historical average)

#### Compounding Frequency
**Annual Compounding**: Interest calculated once per year
**Quarterly Compounding**: Interest calculated four times per year
**Monthly Compounding**: Interest calculated twelve times per year
**Daily Compounding**: Interest calculated 365 times per year

**Impact of Compounding Frequency**:
- **Higher frequency** = More interest earned
- **Monthly compounding** earns more than annual compounding
- **Rule of 72**: Approximation for doubling time

## Mathematical Foundation

### Basic Formulas

#### Future Value Formula
**FV = PV × (1 + r)^n**

Where:
- **FV** = Future Value
- **PV** = Present Value
- **r** = Interest rate per period
- **n** = Number of periods

#### Present Value Formula
**PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)^n**

#### Compound Interest Formula
**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- **A** = Final amount
- **P** = Principal amount
- **r** = Annual interest rate
- **n** = Number of times interest compounded per year
- **t** = Time in years

### Rule of 72
**Purpose**: Quick estimation of how long money takes to double
**Formula**: Years to double = 72 ÷ Interest rate

**Examples**:
- 6% interest: 72 ÷ 6 = 12 years to double
- 8% interest: 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years to double
- 12% interest: 72 ÷ 12 = 6 years to double

**Accuracy**: Works best for interest rates between 6% and 10%

## Applications in Personal Finance

### Savings and Investment Decisions

#### Choosing Between Investment Options

- **After 10 years**: ₹50,000 × (1.08)^10 = ₹1,07,946
- **After 20 years**: ₹50,000 × (1.08)^20 = ₹2,33,048

**Key Insight**: Higher inflation significantly increases future expense requirements

## Advanced Applications

### Net Present Value (NPV)
**Purpose**: Evaluate investment projects or financial decisions
**Formula**: NPV = Sum of (Cash Flow ÷ (1 + r)^t)

**Example**: New Business Investment
- **Initial Investment**: ₹10,00,000
- **Year 1 Cash Flow**: ₹3,00,000
- **Year 2 Cash Flow**: ₹4,00,000
- **Year 3 Cash Flow**: ₹5,00,000
- **Discount Rate**: 10%

**NPV Calculation**:
- Year 1: ₹3,00,000 ÷ (1.10)^1 = ₹2,72,727
- Year 2: ₹4,00,000 ÷ (1.10)^2 = ₹3,30,579
- Year 3: ₹5,00,000 ÷ (1.10)^3 = ₹3,75,657
- **Total PV**: ₹9,78,963
- **NPV**: ₹9,78,963 - ₹10,00,000 = -₹21,037

**Decision**: Reject project (negative NPV)

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
**Purpose**: Find the return rate where NPV equals zero
**Use**: Compare different investment options

**Example**: Compare two investments
- **Investment A**: ₹1,00,000 grows to ₹1,79,000 in 5 years
- **Investment B**: ₹1,00,000 grows to ₹1,61,000 in 4 years

**IRR Calculation**:
- **Investment A**: Rate where (1+r)^5 = 1.79 → r ≈ 12.3%
- **Investment B**: Rate where (1+r)^4 = 1.61 → r ≈ 12.6%

**Decision**: Investment B has slightly higher IRR

### Annuity Calculations

#### Future Value of Annuity
**Scenario**: Monthly SIP of ₹10,000 for 10 years at 12%

**Formula**: FV = PMT × [((1+r)^n - 1) ÷ r]

**Calculation**:
- **PMT**: ₹10,000
- **Monthly Rate**: 12% ÷ 12 = 1%
- **Periods**: 10 × 12 = 120
- **FV**: ₹10,000 × [((1.01)^120 - 1) ÷ 0.01] = ₹23,00,386

#### Present Value of Annuity
**Scenario**: Retirement income of ₹1,00,000 per month for 20 years

**Formula**: PV = PMT × [(1 - (1+r)^-n) ÷ r]

**Calculation**:
- **PMT**: ₹1,00,000
- **Monthly Rate**: 6% ÷ 12 = 0.5%
- **Periods**: 20 × 12 = 240
- **PV**: ₹1,00,000 × [(1 - (1.005)^-240) ÷ 0.005] = ₹1,55,20,694

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Inflation
**Wrong Approach**: Calculating future value without considering inflation
**Right Approach**: Calculate real returns (nominal return - inflation)

**Example**:
- **Nominal Return**: 10%
- **Inflation**: 6%
- **Real Return**: 10% - 6% = 4%
- **True Growth**: Your purchasing power only increases by 4%

### Mistake 2: Using Wrong Time Periods
**Wrong Approach**: Mixing monthly and annual rates incorrectly
**Right Approach**: Ensure consistency in time periods

**Example**:
- **Monthly SIP**: ₹10,000
- **Annual Return**: 12%
- **Monthly Rate**: 12% ÷ 12 = 1%
- **Use monthly rate for monthly calculations**

### Mistake 3: Overlooking Compounding Frequency
**Wrong Approach**: Assuming annual compounding when quarterly/monthly is used
**Right Approach**: Use appropriate compounding frequency

**Example - ₹1,00,000 at 12%**:
- **Annual Compounding**: ₹1,00,000 × 1.12 = ₹1,12,000
- **Monthly Compounding**: ₹1,00,000 × (1.01)^12 = ₹1,12,682
- **Difference**: ₹682 more with monthly compounding

### Mistake 4: Not Considering Taxes
**Wrong Approach**: Ignoring tax impact on returns
**Right Approach**: Calculate after-tax returns

**Example - Fixed Deposit**:
- **Gross Interest**: 7%
- **Tax Rate**: 30% (if applicable)
- **Net Interest**: 7% × (1 - 0.30) = 4.9%
- **Inflation Impact**: May not beat 5% inflation

### Mistake 5: Misunderstanding Risk-Free Rate
**Wrong Approach**: Using high-risk investment returns for discount rate
**Right Approach**: Use appropriate risk-free rate for PV calculations

**For Time Value Calculations**:
- **Conservative**: Government bond yield (5-6%)
- **Moderate**: Fixed deposit rate (6-7%)
- **Aggressive**: Equity return expectation (10-12%)
