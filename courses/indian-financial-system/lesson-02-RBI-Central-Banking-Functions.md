## Introduction

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stands as the cornerstone of India's financial system, much like the central nervous system controls and coordinates all bodily functions. Just as the brain processes information and sends signals to maintain body functions, RBI processes economic data and implements policies to maintain financial stability, control inflation, and promote economic growth.

As India's central bank, RBI plays a multifaceted role that extends far beyond traditional banking functions. It is simultaneously the nation's banker, the government's banker, the regulator of banks, the issuer of currency, the manager of foreign exchange, and the guardian of financial stability. Understanding RBI's functions is essential for comprehending how monetary policy affects everyday financial decisions, from savings interest rates to home loan EMIs.
