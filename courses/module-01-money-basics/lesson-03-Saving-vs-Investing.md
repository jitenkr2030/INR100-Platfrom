## The Cost of Not Investing

### Inflation Impact on Savings

- Inflation adjustment: Worth ₹99,000 in today's money
- **Real loss**: Purchasing power decreases

**If invested in equity (10% return)**:
- After 10 years: ₹2,59,374
- Inflation adjustment: Worth ₹1,74,000 in today's money
- **Real gain**: Purchasing power increases significantly

### Compound Interest Comparison
**Starting Amount**: ₹10,000 monthly for 20 years
**Age**: 25 years old

**Savings Account Scenario (4% annually)**:
- Total Invested: ₹24,00,000
- Final Amount: ₹36,67,000
- **Growth**: ₹12,67,000

**Equity Investment Scenario (10% annually)**:
- Total Invested: ₹24,00,000
- Final Amount: ₹99,91,500
- **Growth**: ₹75,91,500
- **Difference**: ₹63,24,500 more by investing!
