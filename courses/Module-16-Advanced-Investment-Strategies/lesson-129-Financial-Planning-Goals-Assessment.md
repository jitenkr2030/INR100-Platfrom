## Calculating Required Savings

### Future Value Formula

**Current Age**: 35 years
**Expected Annual Return**: 10%

**Calculation**:
- Time horizon: 25 years (300 months)
- Monthly return: 10%/12 = 0.83%
- Required monthly savings: ₹15,000 approximately

### Education Planning Example
**Goal**: ₹50 lakh for child's education in 15 years
**Expected Annual Return**: 8%
**Monthly savings required**: ₹15,000 approximately
