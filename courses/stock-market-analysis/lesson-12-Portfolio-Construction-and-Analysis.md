# Lesson 12: Portfolio Construction and Analysis

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Design diversified investment portfolios
- Apply modern portfolio theory principles
- Analyze portfolio risk and return characteristics
- Rebalance portfolios systematically
- Evaluate portfolio performance effectively

## Portfolio Construction Principles

### Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Developed by Harry Markowitz, MPT emphasizes that investors can maximize returns for a given risk level through diversification.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Risk-Return Tradeoff**: Higher returns require accepting higher risk
- **Efficient Frontier**: Optimal portfolios offering best risk-adjusted returns
- **Diversification**: Reduces risk without necessarily reducing returns

### Asset Allocation
The most important decision in portfolio construction, determining how to distribute investments across asset classes.

#### Strategic Asset Allocation
- **Long-term policy** based on investment goals and risk tolerance
- **Periodic rebalancing** to maintain target allocations
- **Tax-efficient** implementation strategies

#### Dynamic Asset Allocation
- **Tactical adjustments** based on market conditions
- **Opportunistic** reallocation for market inefficiencies
- **Active management** of asset class weights

### Diversification Strategies

#### Across Asset Classes
**Traditional Assets**:
- **Equities**: Stocks for growth potential
- **Fixed Income**: Bonds for stability
- **Cash**: Liquidity and capital preservation

**Alternative Assets**:
- **Real Estate**: Inflation hedge
- **Commodities**: Portfolio diversifier
- **Private Equity**: Illiquidity premium

#### Across Geographies
- **Domestic Exposure**: Home market familiarity
- **International Developed**: Broader market access
- **Emerging Markets**: Growth potential
- **Frontier Markets**: Diversification benefits

#### Across Sectors and Industries
- **Sector Rotation**: Adapting to economic cycles
- **Industry Exposure**: Avoiding concentration risk
- **Factor Diversification**: Value, growth, quality, momentum

## Portfolio Construction Framework

### Step 1: Define Investment Objectives
**Questions to Consider**:
- What is the investment time horizon?
- What is the risk tolerance level?
- What are the income requirements?
- Are there tax considerations?

### Step 2: Strategic Asset Allocation
**Sample Allocations by Risk Profile**:

**Conservative Portfolio**:
- 30% Equities
- 60% Fixed Income
- 10% Cash

**Moderate Portfolio**:
- 60% Equities
- 35% Fixed Income
- 5% Cash

**Aggressive Portfolio**:
- 80% Equities
- 15% Fixed Income
- 5% Cash

### Step 3: Security Selection
**Within Each Asset Class**:
- **Equities**: Individual stocks vs. index funds
- **Fixed Income**: Government vs. corporate bonds
- **Alternatives**: REITs, commodities, hedge funds

### Step 4: Implementation
**Considerations**:
- **Transaction Costs**: Minimize trading expenses
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax implications
- **Liquidity**: Match investment horizon
- **Minimum Investments**: Respect fund minimums

## Portfolio Analysis Techniques

### Risk Metrics

#### Standard Deviation
- **Measure of volatility** around the mean return
- **Higher values** indicate greater risk
- **Lower values** indicate more stable returns

#### Beta
- **Market sensitivity** relative to benchmark
- **Beta > 1**: More volatile than market
- **Beta < 1**: Less volatile than market
- **Beta = 1**: Same volatility as market

#### Value at Risk (VaR)
- **Maximum expected loss** over a given time period
- **95% VaR**: 5% chance of exceeding this loss
- **Statistical measure** of downside risk

#### Sharpe Ratio
- **Risk-adjusted return** measure
- Formula: (Return - Risk-free rate) / Standard deviation
- **Higher ratios** indicate better risk-adjusted performance

### Return Metrics

#### Total Return
- **Capital appreciation** plus income
- **Time-weighted** to account for cash flows
- **Standard performance** measure

#### Annualized Return
- **Compound annual growth rate** (CAGR)
- **Smooths out** year-to-year volatility
- **Standard for long-term** comparisons

#### Alpha
- **Excess return** relative to benchmark
- **Positive alpha**: Outperforming market
- **Negative alpha**: Underperforming market

### Correlation Analysis
**Understanding Relationships**:
- **Correlation = 1**: Perfect positive correlation
- **Correlation = 0**: No relationship
- **Correlation = -1**: Perfect negative correlation

**Portfolio Benefits**:
- **Low correlations** reduce portfolio volatility
- **Negative correlations** provide hedging benefits
- **Optimal portfolios** balance correlation with returns

## Portfolio Rebalancing

### Rebalancing Methods

#### Calendar-based Rebalancing
- **Fixed schedule** (quarterly, semi-annually, annually)
- **Simple to implement** and monitor
- **May miss** market opportunities

#### Threshold-based Rebalancing
- **Triggered when allocation** deviates by set percentage
- **More responsive** to market changes
- **Potential for higher** transaction costs

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Calendar-based with thresholds**
- **Balances** simplicity with responsiveness
- **Professional portfolio** management standard

### Rebalancing Considerations
**Tax Implications**:
- **Tax-loss harvesting** opportunities
- **Tax-efficient** fund placement
- **Municipal bonds** in taxable accounts

**Transaction Costs**:
- **Commission-free** ETF trading
- **Fund expense ratios** impact
- **Market impact** for large trades

**Timing Considerations**:
- **Market conditions** affect rebalancing
- **Volatility** creates opportunities
- **Avoid panic selling** during downturns

## Performance Evaluation

### Benchmark Selection
**Appropriate Benchmarks**:
- **Broad Market Indices**: S&P 500, Total Stock Market
- **Custom Blends**: Match portfolio allocation
- **Peer Groups**: Similar investment strategies

### Performance Attribution
**Sources of Return**:
- **Asset Allocation**: Strategic vs. tactical decisions
- **Security Selection**: Individual investment choices
- **Market Timing**: Entry and exit decisions

### Risk-Adjusted Performance
**Key Measures**:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return per unit of risk
- **Information Ratio**: Active return per unit of active risk
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk focus
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough decline

## Advanced Portfolio Strategies

### Core-Satellite Approach
**Structure**:
- **Core (70-80%)**: Low-cost index funds
- **Satellite (20-30%)**: Active or alternative investments
- **Benefits**: Cost efficiency with growth potential

### Risk Parity
**Philosophy**:
- **Equal risk contribution** from each asset
- **Dynamic allocation** based on volatility
- **Alternative to** traditional market-cap weighting

### Factor-Based Investing
**Investment Themes**:
- **Value**: Undervalued companies
- **Quality**: Strong financials and governance
- **Momentum**: Trend-following strategies
- **Low Volatility**: Defensive characteristics

## Portfolio Monitoring and Reporting

### Regular Review Process
**Monthly**:
- **Performance** vs. benchmarks
- **Allocation drift** from targets
- **Individual position** performance

**Quarterly**:
- **Rebalancing decisions**
- **Tax-loss harvesting** opportunities
- **Strategy effectiveness** review

**Annually**:
- **Investment policy** review
- **Risk tolerance** assessment
- **Fee analysis** and optimization

### Performance Reporting
**Key Metrics to Track**:
- **Total return** (time-weighted)
- **Risk measures** (standard deviation, beta)
- **Risk-adjusted** performance (Sharpe ratio)
- **Benchmark** comparison and attribution

## Key Takeaways

- Portfolio construction is more important than individual security selection
- Diversification across asset classes, geographies, and factors reduces risk
- Regular rebalancing maintains target allocations and manages risk
- Risk-adjusted performance measures provide better comparisons than raw returns
- Systematic evaluation and monitoring improve long-term outcomes
