## Understanding Financial Statements

Financial statements are the primary source of information for fundamental analysis. They provide a standardized way to understand a company's financial position and performance.

### The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet shows what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the difference (shareholders' equity) at a specific point in time.

#### Assets Section

**Current Assets (Convertible to cash within one year)**
- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Ready money and short-term investments
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers
- **Inventory**: Goods ready for sale
- **Short-term Investments**: Temporary investments

**Non-Current Assets (Long-term holdings)**
- **Property, Plant & Equipment**: Physical assets
- **Intangible Assets**: Patents, trademarks, goodwill
- **Long-term Investments**: Strategic holdings
- **Deferred Tax Assets**: Future tax benefits

#### Liabilities Section

**Current Liabilities (Due within one year)**
- **Accounts Payable**: Money owed to suppliers
- **Short-term Debt**: Current portion of long-term debt
- **Accrued Expenses**: Expenses incurred but not yet paid

**Non-Current Liabilities (Long-term obligations)**
- **Long-term Debt**: Loans and bonds
- **Deferred Tax Liabilities**: Future tax obligations
- **Pension Obligations**: Employee retirement benefits

#### Shareholders' Equity
- **Common Stock**: Par value of issued shares
- **Additional Paid-in Capital**: Premium paid over par value
- **Retained Earnings**: Cumulative profits not distributed
- **Treasury Stock**: Shares repurchased by company

### Income Statement Analysis

The income statement shows revenue, expenses, and profit over a period of time.

#### Key Components

**Revenue Section**
- **Gross Revenue**: Total sales before deductions
- **Net Revenue**: Revenue after returns and discounts
- **Revenue Growth**: Year-over-year percentage change

**Expense Section**
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs of production
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus COGS
- **Operating Expenses**: SG&A (Selling, General, Administrative)
- **Operating Income**: Gross profit minus operating expenses

**Bottom Line**
- **Interest Expense**: Cost of borrowed money
- **Tax Expense**: Income taxes
- **Net Income**: Final profit after all expenses

### Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement shows how cash moves in and out of the business.

#### Three Types of Cash Flow

**1. Operating Cash Flow**
- Cash from core business operations
- Includes changes in working capital
- Key indicator of business health

**2. Investing Cash Flow**
- Capital expenditures (CapEx)
- Acquisitions and divestitures
- Purchase and sale of investments

**3. Financing Cash Flow**
- Debt issuance and repayment
- Dividend payments
- Share buybacks and issuances

### Financial Statement Analysis Techniques

#### Horizontal Analysis
Compare financial statement items over multiple periods:
- Calculate percentage change from year to year
- Identify trends and patterns
- Spot accelerating or decelerating growth

#### Vertical Analysis
Express each line item as a percentage of a base figure:
- Balance sheet: Assets = 100%
- Income statement: Revenue = 100%
- Compare company structure over time

#### Ratio Analysis
Calculate relationships between financial statement items:
- **Liquidity Ratios**: Current ratio, quick ratio
- **Profitability Ratios**: ROE, ROA, profit margins
- **Efficiency Ratios**: Asset turnover, inventory turnover
- **Leverage Ratios**: Debt-to-equity, interest coverage

### Red Flags to Watch For

#### Balance Sheet Red Flags
- **Declining Cash**: Despite strong earnings
- **Rising Debt**: Without corresponding asset growth
- **Shrinking Equity**: Due to losses or buybacks
- **High Receivables**: May indicate collection issues

#### Income Statement Red Flags
- **Inconsistent Revenue**: Volatile or declining trends
- **Margin Compression**: Shrinking profit margins
- **One-time Gains**: Temporary boosts to earnings
- **Rising Expenses**: Faster than revenue growth

#### Cash Flow Red Flags
- **Negative Operating Cash Flow**: Despite profits
- **High CapEx**: Without revenue justification
- **Dividends**: When cash flow is insufficient
- **Asset Sales**: To fund operations

### Practical Example

Let's analyze a hypothetical company:

**XYZ Corp - 5-Year Financial Summary**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 5 | CAGR |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Revenue | $100M | $180M | 12.5% |
| Net Income | $10M | $12M | 3.8% |
| Cash | $20M | $15M | -5.6% |
| Debt | $30M | $50M | 10.7% |

**Analysis**:
- Strong revenue growth but profit growth lagging
- Cash declining despite profits
- Debt growing faster than assets
- Warning signs of financial stress

## Key Takeaways

- Financial statements provide standardized financial information
- Use horizontal and vertical analysis to identify trends
- Watch for red flags like declining cash or rising debt
- Cash flow is more important than accounting profits
- Ratio analysis helps compare companies across time
