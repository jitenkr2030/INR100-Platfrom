# Lesson 5: Chart Patterns and Trends

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- Different types of price charts and their applications
- How to identify and interpret chart patterns
- Trend analysis and support/resistance levels
- Volume confirmation of price movements

## Types of Charts

### Candlestick Charts
The most popular chart type for technical analysis, showing open, high, low, and close prices.

**Candlestick Components**:
- **Body**: Range between open and close
- **Wicks/Shadows**: High and low prices
- **Color**: Green (bullish) or Red (bearish)

**Key Candlestick Patterns**:
- **Doji**: Indecision, potential reversal
- **Hammer**: Potential bullish reversal at support
- **Shooting Star**: Potential bearish reversal at resistance
- **Engulfing**: Strong reversal signals

### Line Charts
Simple charts connecting closing prices over time.
- **Use**: Identifying overall trend direction
- **Limitation**: No information about intraday movements

### Bar Charts
Show open, high, low, and close in vertical bars.
- **Left tick**: Opening price
- **Right tick**: Closing price
- **Top**: Highest price
- **Bottom**: Lowest price

## Understanding Trends

### Trend Definition
A trend is the general direction of price movement over time.

**Types of Trends**:
1. **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows
2. **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows
3. **Sideways**: Horizontal movement, no clear direction

### Trend Lines
Lines drawn connecting significant highs or lows to identify trend direction.

**Drawing Trend Lines**:
- **Uptrend Line**: Connect rising lows
- **Downtrend Line**: Connect falling highs
- **Validation**: Must touch at least 3 points

### Channels
Parallel trend lines creating a price corridor.

**Channel Types**:
- **Ascending Channel**: Uptrend with parallel resistance
- **Descending Channel**: Downtrend with parallel support
- **Horizontal Channel**: Sideways movement

## Major Chart Patterns

### Reversal Patterns

#### Head and Shoulders
**Characteristics**:
- Left shoulder, head, right shoulder
- Neckline break confirms reversal
- Volume decreases during formation

**Trading Strategy**:
- Enter on neckline break
- Target: Height of head projected downward

#### Double Top/Bottom
**Double Top**:
- Two peaks at similar levels
- Breakdown through neckline confirms
- Bearish reversal pattern

**Double Bottom**:
- Two troughs at similar levels
- Breakout through neckline confirms
- Bullish reversal pattern

#### Triple Top/Bottom
- Three peaks/troughs at similar levels
- Stronger reversal signals than double patterns
- Same trading approach as double patterns

### Continuation Patterns

#### Flags and Pennants
**Flag Characteristics**:
- Strong price move (flagpole)
- Sideways consolidation (flag)
- Continuation in direction of pole

**Pennant Characteristics**:
- Strong price move (flagpole)
- Converging consolidation (pennant)
- Breakout continuation expected

#### Triangles
**Ascending Triangle**:
- Flat resistance, rising support
- Bullish breakout expected
- Volume increases on breakout

**Descending Triangle**:
- Flat support, falling resistance
- Bearish breakdown expected
- Volume increases on breakdown

**Symmetrical Triangle**:
- Converging trend lines
- Breakout in either direction
- Higher volume confirms direction

#### Rectangles
- Horizontal support and resistance
- Price consolidates between levels
- Breakout in either direction possible

### Support and Resistance

#### Support Levels
**Definition**: Price levels where buying interest emerges
**Characteristics**:
- Previous lows act as support
- Volume increases at support
- Bounce probability increases

#### Resistance Levels
**Definition**: Price levels where selling pressure emerges
**Characteristics**:
- Previous highs act as resistance
- Volume increases at resistance
- Rejection probability increases

#### Role Reversal
- Support becomes resistance when broken
- Resistance becomes support when broken
- Stronger on multiple tests

## Volume Analysis

### Volume Confirmation
**Principle**: Price movements with high volume are more reliable

**Volume Indicators**:
- **OBV (On-Balance Volume)**: Cumulative volume measure
- **Volume Rate of Change**: Percentage change in volume
- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**: Average price by volume

### Volume Patterns
**Accumulation**: Rising price with increasing volume
**Distribution**: Rising price with decreasing volume
**Climax**: Extremely high volume (reversal likely)

## Practical Application

### Pattern Recognition Checklist
1. **Identify the Pattern**
   - Is it complete or forming?
   - Does it have volume confirmation?
   - Are target levels measurable?

2. **Entry Strategy**
   - Wait for breakout confirmation
   - Enter on volume spike
   - Set stop loss below pattern low

3. **Risk Management**
   - Position size based on pattern height
   - Stop loss at pattern boundary
   - Take profits at measured moves

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Pattern Misidentification**: Seeing patterns that don't exist
- **Ignoring Volume**: Price moves need volume confirmation
- **Premature Entries**: Entering before pattern completion
- **Poor Risk Management**: Not using stop losses

## Chart Reading Exercise

**Example Scenario**:
Stock XYZ has formed a Head and Shoulders pattern:
- Left shoulder at $100
- Head at $120
- Right shoulder at $100
- Neckline at $90
- Current price: $95

**Analysis**:
- Pattern target: $90 - ($120 - $90) = $60
- Entry: On breakdown below $90
- Stop loss: Above $100
- Risk/Reward: 1:3 ratio

## Key Takeaways

- Chart patterns help predict future price movements
- Volume confirmation is crucial for pattern validity
- Support and resistance levels provide entry/exit points
- Trend lines and channels guide price action
- Risk management is essential in pattern trading
