## Introduction

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) serves as the guardian of India's securities markets, ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient functioning of stock exchanges, protecting investor interests, and promoting the development of the securities market. Like a vigilant traffic policeman on the financial highway, SEBI ensures that all participants—issuers, intermediaries, and investors—follow the rules of the road, creating a safe and orderly marketplace for securities trading.

Established in 1988 and given statutory powers in 1992, SEBI has evolved into one of India's most powerful financial regulators, wielding significant authority to enforce compliance, punish violations, and shape market development policies that impact millions of investors and crores of rupees in market transactions.

Understanding SEBI's role is essential for anyone involved in securities markets—be it as an investor, trader, market intermediary, or issuer of securities. SEBI's decisions and policies directly affect market accessibility, trading costs, investor protection measures, and the overall health of India's capital markets.
