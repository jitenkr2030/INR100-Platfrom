## Introduction

The demat account represents one of the most revolutionary transformations in Indian securities markets, eliminating the cumbersome era of physical share certificates and ushering in a digital-first approach to securities holding and trading. Like transitioning from handwritten letters to instant messaging, dematerialization (demat) changed how securities are stored, transferred, and managed, making Indian markets more efficient, secure, and accessible to millions of investors.

Before demat accounts, investors had to physically collect, store, and transfer share certificates, which were vulnerable to loss, theft, forgery, and damage. The introduction of demat accounts transformed this experience completely, enabling electronic holding, instant transfer, and seamless settlement, while dramatically reducing costs and risks associated with physical securities.

Today, with over 10 crore demat accounts in India, demat accounts have become as essential as bank accounts for anyone participating in securities markets. Understanding how demat accounts work, their benefits, and their ecosystem is crucial for modern investors, traders, and financial professionals in India's dynamic financial landscape.
