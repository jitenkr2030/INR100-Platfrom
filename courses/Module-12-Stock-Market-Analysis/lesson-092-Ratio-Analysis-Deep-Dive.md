## Core Content

### 1. Introduction to Financial Ratio Analysis

Financial ratio analysis is a quantitative method of evaluating a company's financial performance by examining relationships between different financial variables. These ratios help investors, analysts, and managers understand various aspects of business health including profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency.

**Core Purpose**: Transform raw financial data into meaningful insights for decision-making

### 2. Indian Financial Reporting Context

In India, companies follow Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) or Companies Act 2013 requirements:
- **Ind AS**: Convergence with IFRS for listed companies
- **RBI Guidelines**: Additional requirements for financial institutions
- **SEBI Regulations**: Enhanced disclosure requirements for public companies
- **MCA Filings**: Annual filings with detailed financial statements

### 3. Categories of Financial Ratios

#### 3.1 Liquidity Ratios
Measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations

**Current Ratio**
- Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Interpretation: Values above 1.5 indicate good short-term liquidity
- Industry Benchmark: Manufacturing (1.5-2.5), IT (1.0-1.5)

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test)**
- Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- More conservative than current ratio
- Values above 1.0 generally considered healthy

**Cash Ratio**
- Formula: Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities
- Most conservative liquidity measure
- Values above 0.2-0.3 are typically acceptable

#### 3.2 Profitability Ratios
Evaluate how effectively a company generates profits

**Gross Profit Margin**
- Formula: (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100
- Indicates pricing power and production efficiency
- Indian IT: 20-30%, Manufacturing: 15-25%

**Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin)**
- Formula: Operating Income / Revenue × 100
- Measures operational efficiency before interest and taxes
- Technology companies: 15-25%, Retail: 5-15%

**Net Profit Margin**
- Formula: Net Income / Revenue × 100
- Overall profitability after all expenses
- Healthy range: 10-15% for established companies

**Return on Assets (ROA)**
- Formula: Net Income / Total Assets × 100
- Measures asset utilization efficiency
- Benchmark: Banks (1-2%), Manufacturing (5-8%)

**Return on Equity (ROE)**
- Formula: Net Income / Shareholders' Equity × 100
- Key metric for shareholders
- Strong companies: 15-25% ROE

#### 3.3 Leverage Ratios
Assess the extent of debt financing

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
- Formula: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
- Measures financial leverage
- Conservative: <0.5, Moderate: 0.5-1.5, Aggressive: >1.5

**Debt-to-Assets Ratio**
- Formula: Total Debt / Total Assets
- Alternative leverage measure
- Values below 0.6 generally considered safe

**Interest Coverage Ratio**
- Formula: EBIT / Interest Expense
- Ability to service debt interest
- Values above 3.0 indicate strong debt service capacity

**Debt Service Coverage Ratio**
- Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt Service
- Comprehensive debt service ability
- Values above 1.25 are typically required by lenders

#### 3.4 Efficiency Ratios (Activity Ratios)
Measure how effectively a company uses its assets

**Inventory Turnover Ratio**
- Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
- Frequency of inventory replacement
- Retail: 8-12, Manufacturing: 4-8

**Receivables Turnover Ratio**
- Formula: Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
- Efficiency of collection
- Industry average: 6-8 times per year

**Asset Turnover Ratio**
- Formula: Revenue / Total Assets
- Efficiency of asset utilization
- Asset-intensive businesses: 0.5-1.0, Asset-light: 2.0+

**Working Capital Turnover**
- Formula: Revenue / Working Capital
- Efficiency of working capital management

#### 3.5 Market Ratios
Relevant for publicly traded companies

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
- Formula: Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
- Most widely used valuation metric
- Indian market average: 15-25

**Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**
- Formula: Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
- Useful for asset-heavy businesses
- Values below 1.0 may indicate undervaluation

**Dividend Yield**
- Formula: Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share
- Income return for shareholders
- Stable dividend-paying companies: 2-4%

**Enterprise Value (EV/EBITDA)**
- Formula: Enterprise Value / EBITDA
- Capital structure neutral valuation metric
- Comparable across companies with different debt levels

Bankruptcy prediction model:
- Z = 1.2(X1) + 1.4(X2) + 3.3(X3) + 0.6(X4) + 1.0(X5)
- X1 = Working Capital/Total Assets
- X2 = Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- X3 = EBIT/Total Assets
- X4 = Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities
- X5 = Sales/Total Assets
- Z > 2.99: Safe zone
- Z 1.81-2.99: Grey zone
