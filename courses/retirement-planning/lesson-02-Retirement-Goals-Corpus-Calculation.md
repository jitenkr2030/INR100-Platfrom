## Section 2: Corpus Calculation Methodologies

### Traditional Corpus Calculation Method

**Simple Future Value Calculation**
1. **Basic Formula**
   ```
   Corpus = Monthly Savings × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r
   ```
   Where:
   - r = Monthly return rate
   - n = Number of months

2. **Example Calculation**
   - Monthly savings: ₹20,000
   - Annual return: 10%
   - Monthly return: 0.83%
   - Period: 30 years (360 months)
   - Corpus = ₹20,000 × [(1.0083)^360 - 1] / 0.0083
   - **Estimated Corpus: ₹4.05 crore**

**Annuity Factor Method**
1. **Annuity Calculation**
   ```
   Monthly Income = Corpus × r / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]
   ```
   Where:
   - r = Monthly withdrawal rate
   - n = Number of months in retirement

2. **Reverse Calculation**
   ```
   Required Corpus = Required Monthly Income × [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r
   ```
   Example:
   - Required monthly income: ₹75,000
   - Expected return: 8% annually
   - Monthly return: 0.67%
   - Retirement period: 25 years (300 months)
   - Required corpus = ₹75,000 × [1 - (1.0067)^-300] / 0.0067
   - **Required Corpus: ₹1.18 crore**

### Inflation-Adjusted Calculations

**Real Return Approach**
1. **Real Return Formula**
   ```
   Real Return = (1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1
   ```
   Example:
   - Nominal return: 10%
   - Inflation rate: 6%
   - Real return = (1.10 / 1.06) - 1 = 3.77%

2. **Inflation-Adjusted Corpus**
   ```
   Real Corpus = Current Expense × (1 + Real Return)^n
   ```
   Example:
   - Current monthly expense: ₹50,000
   - Real return: 3.77%
   - Years to retirement: 25
   - Real corpus = ₹50,000 × (1.0377)^25
   - **Future expense: ₹1.36 lakh/month**

**Current Expense Projection**
1. **Inflation Impact Calculation**
   ```
   Future Expense = Current Expense × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years
   ```
   Example:
   - Current expense: ₹50,000/month
   - Inflation rate: 6%
   - Years: 25
   - Future expense = ₹50,000 × (1.06)^25
   - **Future expense: ₹2.15 lakh/month**

2. **Corpus Requirement with Inflation**
   ```
   Corpus Required = Future Monthly Expense × 12 × Annuity Factor
   ```
   - Future monthly expense: ₹2.15 lakh
   - Annual expense: ₹25.8 lakh
   - Using 8% return over 25 years
   - **Required Corpus: ₹3.47 crore**

### Monte Carlo Simulation Method

**Probability-Based Approach**
1. **Simulation Process**
   - Generate thousands of return scenarios
   - Factor in market volatility
   - Account for sequence of returns risk
   - Calculate success probability

2. **Input Parameters**
   - Expected return: 10% ± 15% volatility
   - Inflation: 6% ± 2% volatility
   - Retirement period: 25 years
   - Withdrawal rate: 4% annually

**Success Rate Analysis**
1. **Outcome Scenarios**
   - Success (corpus lasts full retirement): 75-85%
   - Moderate risk (corpus depletes early): 10-15%
   - High risk (corpus depletes quickly): 5-10%

2. **Risk Adjustment**
   - Lower withdrawal rate for higher success
   - Diversified portfolio for stability
   - Dynamic spending adjustments
   - Emergency fund maintenance

### Rule-Based Methods

**4% Withdrawal Rule**
1. **Rule Application**
   - Withdraw 4% of initial corpus annually
   - Adjust for inflation each year
   - Based on historical US market data
   - Conservative approach for sustainability

2. **Indian Market Adaptation**
   - Consider higher inflation in India
   - Adjust for market volatility differences
   - Factor in healthcare cost inflation
   - **Modified rate: 3-3.5% for safety**

**Multiply by 25 Rule**
1. **Simple Calculation**
   - Required annual expense × 25 = Required corpus
   - Based on 4% withdrawal rate
   - Easy mental calculation
   - Quick estimation tool

2. **Indian Context Adjustment**
   - Consider higher inflation
   - Factor in healthcare costs
   - Account for market volatility
   - **Modified: Required annual expense × 30-35**
