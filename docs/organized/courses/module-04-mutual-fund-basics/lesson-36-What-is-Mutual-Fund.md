## Understanding Mutual Funds

### Definition and Core Concept

#### What is a Mutual Fund
**Basic Definition**:
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Professional fund managers manage these portfolios on behalf of all investors, who own shares (called "units") in the fund proportional to their investment amount.

**Key Characteristics**:
