# Lesson 48: Fund Performance Analysis

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand different methods of measuring fund performance
- Analyze risk-adjusted returns using key metrics
- Compare fund performance against appropriate benchmarks
- Interpret performance attribution and understand sources of returns
- Use performance data to make informed investment decisions

## Introduction: Beyond Simple Returns

Evaluating mutual fund performance requires looking beyond absolute returns to understand how those returns were generated, what risks were taken, and how the fund compares to suitable alternatives. This comprehensive analysis helps investors make better decisions and avoid common pitfalls like performance chasing or panicking during temporary setbacks.

Proper performance analysis provides insights into:
- Whether returns justify the risks taken
- How fund managers add value through their decisions
- How funds perform in different market conditions
- Whether fund quality is consistent over time

## Understanding Performance Measurement Methods

### Absolute vs. Relative Performance

#### Absolute Performance
Absolute performance measures the actual return generated by the fund, regardless of market conditions or comparisons.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple to understand (percentage gain or loss)
- Shows actual wealth creation or destruction
- Important for goal-based planning
- Doesn't account for market context

**Example:**
- Fund A gained 12% in a year
- This is absolute performance
- Good if markets were flat, excellent if markets fell

#### Relative Performance
Relative performance measures returns compared to a benchmark or peer group, putting results in context.

**Types of Relative Performance:**
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Against a market index
- **Peer Group Ranking**: Against similar funds
- **Category Performance**: Against fund category average

**Example:**
- Fund A gained 12% while benchmark gained 15%
- Absolute return: 12% (appears good)
- Relative return: -3% (underperformed benchmark)

### Time Period Analysis

#### Different Time Horizons
Performance must be analyzed across multiple time periods to get a complete picture:

**Short-term (1 year):**
- Shows recent market conditions impact
- High volatility in rankings
- Influenced by market timing luck

**Medium-term (3 years):**
- Smooths out some market noise
- Better indicator of management consistency
- Shows performance across market cycles

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Best indicator of management skill
- Removes market timing effects
- Shows sustainable performance patterns

#### Rolling Returns Analysis
Rolling returns show performance consistency by calculating returns over overlapping periods.

**Example Rolling Returns:**
```
3-Year Rolling Returns for Fund A:
Period 1 (Jan 2021-Dec 2023): 10.2%
Period 2 (Feb 2021-Jan 2024): 11.8%
Period 3 (Mar 2021-Feb 2024): 9.5%
Period 4 (Apr 2021-Mar 2024): 12.1%

Pattern Analysis:
- Consistent positive performance
- Relatively stable returns
- Lower volatility than single-period analysis
```

## Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics

### Understanding Risk-Adjusted Returns

Risk-adjusted returns account for the amount of risk taken to achieve returns. Two funds with similar absolute returns may have very different risk profiles.

**Why Risk Adjustment Matters:**
- Higher returns often come with higher risks
- Risk-adjusted metrics reveal true performance quality
- Helps match funds to investor risk tolerance
- Enables better portfolio construction

### Sharpe Ratio

#### Definition and Calculation
The Sharpe Ratio measures returns above the risk-free rate per unit of volatility.

**Formula:**
Sharpe Ratio = (Fund Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Fund Volatility

**Example Calculation:**
- Fund Return: 12%
- Risk-Free Rate: 4% (government bonds)
- Fund Volatility: 15%
- Sharpe Ratio = (12% - 4%) / 15% = 0.53

#### Interpretation Guidelines

**Sharpe Ratio Ranges:**
- **Above 1.0**: Excellent risk-adjusted performance
- **0.5 - 1.0**: Good risk-adjusted performance
- **0.25 - 0.5**: Average risk-adjusted performance
- **Below 0.25**: Poor risk-adjusted performance

**Practical Example:**
```
Fund A vs Fund B Comparison:
                    Fund A    Fund B
Absolute Return     12%       15%
Volatility          10%       25%
Sharpe Ratio        0.80      0.44

Analysis:
- Fund B has higher absolute returns
- Fund A provides better risk-adjusted returns
- Fund A may be more suitable for risk-averse investors
```

### Sortino Ratio

#### Why Sortino Ratio Matters
The Sortino Ratio improves on Sharpe Ratio by only penalizing downside volatility, not upside volatility.

**Formula:**
Sortino Ratio = (Fund Return - Target Return) / Downside Deviation

**Example Calculation:**
```
Monthly Returns: 15%, -5%, 8%, 12%, -2%
Target Return: 5%

Downside Deviations:
Month 1: min(15%-5%, 0) = 0%
Month 2: min(-5%-5%, 0) = -10%
Month 3: min(8%-5%, 0) = 0%
Month 4: min(12%-5%, 0) = 0%
Month 5: min(-2%-5%, 0) = -7%

Downside Deviation = sqrt((0 + 100 + 0 + 0 + 49)/5) = 5.48%
Sortino Ratio = (12% - 5%) / 5.48% = 1.28
```

**Advantages of Sortino Ratio:**
- Doesn't penalize upside volatility
- Better for investors concerned about losses
- More appropriate for asymmetric return distributions

### Maximum Drawdown

#### Definition and Significance
Maximum drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in fund value.

**Calculation Example:**
```
Portfolio Value Over Time:
Jan: ₹1,00,000
Feb: ₹1,10,000 (Peak)
Mar: ₹1,08,000
Apr: ₹95,000
May: ₹1,02,000
Jun: ₹1,15,000

Maximum Drawdown Calculation:
Peak Value: ₹1,10,000
Trough Value: ₹95,000
Drawdown = (₹1,10,000 - ₹95,000) / ₹1,10,000 = 13.6%
```

**Why Maximum Drawdown Matters:**
- Measures worst-case scenario losses
- Important for risk-averse investors
- Shows recovery time needed after losses
- Helps determine emotional stress tolerance

**Drawdown Analysis by Fund Category:**

| Fund Category | Typical Max Drawdown | Recovery Time |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Large Cap | 40-50% | 2-3 years |
| Mid Cap | 50-60% | 3-4 years |
| Small Cap | 60-70% | 4-5 years |
| Debt Funds | 5-15% | 6-12 months |

## Benchmark Analysis and Selection

### Understanding Benchmarks

#### What Makes a Good Benchmark
A good benchmark should be:
- **Relevant**: Matches the fund's investment style
- **Investable**: Can be replicated by investors
- **Transparent**: Clearly defined and accessible
- **Appropriate**: Reflects the fund's risk profile

#### Benchmark Selection Examples

**Large Cap Growth Fund:**
- Primary Benchmark: Nifty 50 TRI
- Rationale: Similar market cap focus and growth orientation

**Mid Cap Fund:**
- Primary Benchmark: Nifty Midcap 150 TRI
- Rationale: Matches mid cap size and style characteristics

**Debt Fund:**
- Primary Benchmark: CRISIL 10 Year Gilt Index
- Rationale: Similar duration and credit risk profile

**Hybrid Fund (60:40):**
- Primary Benchmark: 60% Nifty 50 + 40% CRISIL Composite Bond Fund Index
- Rationale: Matches the fund's asset allocation

### Custom Benchmark Construction

#### When Standard Benchmarks Don't Fit
Some funds require custom benchmarks due to unique investment strategies.

**Example: Multi-Cap Fund**
```
Standard Approach: Use Nifty 200
Custom Approach: Use weighted index
- 50% Nifty 50 (Large Cap)
- 30% Nifty Midcap 150 (Mid Cap)
- 20% Nifty Smallcap 250 (Small Cap)

Rationale: Better reflects the fund's true market exposure
```

#### Style Box Benchmarking
**Concept**: Create composite benchmarks that match fund's style characteristics.

**Example: Thematic Fund**
```
Fund: Technology Focus Fund
Custom Benchmark:
- 70% Nifty 50 (Broad market base)
- 30% BSE Tech Index (Sector tilt)

This reflects both broad diversification and sector focus
```

### Benchmark Comparison Analysis

#### Active Return Calculation
Active Return = Fund Return - Benchmark Return

**Example:**
- Fund Return: 13.5%
- Benchmark Return: 12.2%
- Active Return: 1.3%

**Interpretation:**
- Positive active return: Outperformed benchmark
- Negative active return: Underperformed benchmark
- Magnitude shows degree of outperformance/underperformance

#### Tracking Error
Tracking Error measures how closely the fund follows its benchmark.

**Calculation:**
Standard deviation of active returns over a period.

**Interpretation:**
- Low tracking error: Fund closely tracks benchmark
- High tracking error: Fund deviates significantly from benchmark
- Expected for actively managed funds

## Performance Attribution Analysis

### Understanding Return Sources

Fund returns come from multiple sources:
1. **Market Movement**: Overall market performance
2. **Asset Allocation**: Decision to overweight/underweight asset classes
3. **Security Selection**: Choosing specific stocks/bonds
4. **Market Timing**: Moving in/out of markets at favorable times

### Brinson Attribution Model

#### Three-Factor Attribution
Total Active Return = Allocation Effect + Selection Effect + Interaction Effect

#### Practical Example

**Quarterly Attribution Analysis:**

```
Sector Performance:
                    Portfolio        Benchmark
Sector        Weight   Return   Weight    Return
Technology      25%     12%      20%      10%
Healthcare      20%      8%      25%       6%
Financials      15%     15%      20%      12%
Others          40%      5%      35%       4%
Total          100%    10.05%   100%      8.6%

Portfolio Return: 10.05%
Benchmark Return: 8.6%
Active Return: 1.45%
```

**Attribution Calculations:**

**Allocation Effect:**
- Technology: (25% - 20%) × (10% - 8.6%) = 0.28%
- Healthcare: (20% - 25%) × (6% - 8.6%) = 0.52%
- Financials: (15% - 20%) × (12% - 8.6%) = 0.68%
- Others: (40% - 35%) × (4% - 8.6%) = 1.84%
- Total Allocation Effect: 3.32%

**Selection Effect:**
- Technology: 25% × (12% - 10%) = 0.50%
- Healthcare: 20% × (8% - 6%) = 0.40%
- Financials: 15% × (15% - 12%) = 0.45%
- Others: 40% × (5% - 4%) = 0.40%
- Total Selection Effect: 1.75%

**Interpretation:**
- Allocation decisions added 3.32% to returns
- Selection decisions added 1.75% to returns
- Manager demonstrated skill in both areas

### Factor-Based Attribution

#### Common Factors Affecting Returns
- **Market Factor**: Overall market movement
- **Size Factor**: Large vs. small company exposure
- **Value Factor**: Value vs. growth company exposure
- **Quality Factor**: High vs. low quality company exposure

#### Fama-French Three-Factor Model
**Formula:**
Fund Return = Risk-Free Rate + β₁(Market Return) + β₂(SMB) + β₃(HML) + α

**Example Analysis:**
```
Fund Return Components:
- Risk-Free Rate: 3.0%
- Market Beta: 1.15
- Market Return: 10.0%
- Size Beta: 0.3
- SMB Return: 2.5%
- Value Beta: -0.2
- HML Return: -1.0%
- Alpha: 0.5%

Return Attribution:
Expected Return = 3.0% + 1.15×10.0% + 0.3×2.5% + (-0.2)×(-1.0%) = 15.05%
Alpha Contribution: 0.5%
Total Return: 15.55%
```

## Peer Group Analysis

### Understanding Peer Groups

#### Peer Group Construction
Peer groups should include funds with similar:
- Investment objective and strategy
- Asset class focus
- Risk profile
- Expense structure
- Minimum track record (typically 3+ years)

#### Morningstar Category System

**Equity Fund Categories:**
- Large Growth
- Large Blend
- Large Value
- Mid-Cap Growth

- Small Value

**Other Fund Categories:**
- Debt Funds (by duration and credit quality)
- Hybrid Funds (by equity-debt ratio)
- Thematic Funds (by investment theme)

### Ranking Methodologies

#### Percentile Rankings
Percentile ranking shows how a fund performs relative to its peers.

**Example Quarterly Rankings:**
```
Fund Performance Percentiles:
Q1 2024: 15th percentile (better than 85% of peers)
Q2 2024: 45th percentile (better than 55% of peers)
Q3 2024: 5th percentile (better than 95% of peers)

Consistency Analysis:
- Above median in 2 out of 3 quarters
- Excellent performance in Q3
- Overall above-average performance
```

#### Risk-Adjusted Rankings
Ranking funds by risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns.

**Example: Sharpe Ratio Rankings**
```
Peer Group Sharpe Ratios:
Fund A: 0.85 (25th percentile)
Fund B: 0.72 (45th percentile)
Fund C: 0.91 (15th percentile)
Peer Median: 0.75

Interpretation:
- Fund C: Top quartile risk-adjusted performance
- Consistent superior risk management
- Better choice for risk-conscious investors
```

### Performance Persistence Analysis

#### Win-Loss Analysis
Measures how consistently a fund performs relative to peers.

**Example Analysis:**
```
Rolling 12-Month Performance:
Year 1: Win (top half)
Year 2: Win (top half)
Year 3: Loss (bottom half)
Year 4: Win (top half)
Year 5: Win (top half)
Year 6: Win (top half)

Win Rate: 5/6 = 83%
Statistical Significance: Evidence of skill
Conclusion: Consistent above-average performance
```

#### Hot and Cold Hands Analysis
Examines if performance winners continue to outperform.

**Multi-Period Analysis:**
```
Fund A Performance:
Period 1 (2018-2019): 3rd of 50 peers
Period 2 (2020-2021): 1st of 50 peers
Period 3 (2022-2023): 8th of 50 peers

Cross-Period Correlation: 0.65
Interpretation: Strong positive correlation suggests persistent skill
```

## Modern Performance Metrics

### Information Ratio

#### Definition and Use
Information Ratio measures active return per unit of active risk.

**Formula:**
Information Ratio = Active Return / Tracking Error

**Example:**
- Active Return: 1.5%
- Tracking Error: 3.0%
- Information Ratio = 1.5% / 3.0% = 0.50

**Interpretation:**
- Above 0.5: Good active management
- Above 1.0: Excellent active management
- Below 0.25: Poor active management

### Calmar Ratio

#### Focus on Drawdowns
Calmar Ratio emphasizes downside risk management.

**Formula:**
Calmar Ratio = Average Annual Return / Maximum Drawdown

**Example:**
- 3-Year Average Return: 12.5%
- Maximum Drawdown: -18%
- Calmar Ratio = 12.5% / 18% = 0.69

**Comparison:**
```
Fund Comparison by Calmar Ratio:
Fund A: 0.69
Fund B: 0.45
Fund C: 0.82

Fund C provides the best risk-adjusted returns considering drawdowns
```

### Omega Ratio

#### Distribution-Based Measure
Omega Ratio considers the entire return distribution, not just mean and variance.

**Interpretation:**
- Omega > 1: Positive asymmetry in returns
- Higher Omega: Better risk-return profile
- More informative for skewed distributions
