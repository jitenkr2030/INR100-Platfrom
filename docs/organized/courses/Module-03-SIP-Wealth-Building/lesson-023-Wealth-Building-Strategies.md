### 2. Retirement Planning

**Scenario**: Age 30, retirement at 60, current monthly expense ₹50,000

**Calculation:**
- Current annual expense: ₹6 lakh
- Inflation: 6%
- Retirement age expense: ₹6 lakh × (1.06)^30 = ₹34.45 lakh

| Child Education | ₹8,000 | Equity Fund | ₹50 lakh |

## Building Wealth Through Compounding

### The Millionaire Formula

**For Creating ₹1 Crore:**

| Monthly SIP | Return Rate | Time Required |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| ₹15,000 | 12% | 19 years |
| ₹20,000 | 12% | 16 years |
| ₹25,000 | 12% | 14 years |
| ₹30,000 | 12% | 12 years |

### The 1% Rule
Increase your SIP amount by 1% of your income annually. For a ₹50,000 income, this means increasing SIP by ₹500 each year.

**Impact over 20 years:**
