## Valuation Methods in Private Markets

### Income Approach

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
**Methodology**:
```
Enterprise Value = Σ [FCF(t) / (1 + WACC)^t] + Terminal Value
Where:
FCF(t) = Free Cash Flow in year t
WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital
Terminal Value = FCF(n+1) / (WACC - g)
```

**DCF Example: Manufacturing Company**
```
Year 1 FCF: ₹50 crores
Year 2 FCF: ₹60 crores
Year 3 FCF: ₹75 crores
Terminal Growth: 3%
WACC: 12%

PV of Cash Flows:
Year 1: ₹44.6 crores
Year 2: ₹47.8 crores
Year 3: ₹53.3 crores
Terminal Value: ₹833.3 crores
Enterprise Value: ₹979 crores
```

#### Capitalized Earnings Method
**Application**: Stable, mature businesses
**Formula**:
```
Business Value = Normalized Earnings / Capitalization Rate
Capitalization Rate = Discount Rate - Growth Rate
```

### Market Approach

#### Comparable Company Analysis
**Method**: Use trading multiples of similar public companies

**Common Multiples**:
- EV/Revenue: 3-8x for growth companies
- EV/EBITDA: 8-15x for mature companies
- P/E Ratio: 15-25x for stable earnings
- Price/Book: 1.5-3x for asset-heavy businesses

**Multiple Analysis Example**:
```
Company A: EV/EBITDA = 12x
Company B: EV/EBITDA = 10x  
Company C: EV/EBITDA = 14x
Industry Average: 12x
Target EBITDA: ₹100 crores
Valuation: 12 × ₹100 = ₹1,200 crores
```

#### Precedent Transaction Analysis
**Process**:
1. Identify relevant transactions
2. Adjust for transaction-specific factors
3. Apply multiple ranges
4. Consider control premiums

**Transaction Multiples**:
- Typically 20-30% higher than trading multiples
- Include control premium
- Reflect strategic value
- Account for synergies

### Asset Approach

#### Net Asset Value (NAV)
**Application**: Asset-heavy businesses, holding companies
**Calculation**:
```
NAV = Fair Market Value of Assets - Liabilities
Where:
Assets = Land, buildings, equipment, investments
Liabilities = Debt, contingent liabilities
```

#### Asset-Based Valuation Example
```
Real Estate Development Company:
Land Assets: ₹500 crores
Development Assets: ₹200 crores
Cash and Equivalents: ₹50 crores
Total Assets: ₹750 crores
Total Liabilities: ₹300 crores
Net Asset Value: ₹450 crores
```

### Venture Capital Method

#### Stage-Based Valuation
**Seed Stage**:
- Pre-revenue: ₹10-50 lakhs valuation
- Early revenue: ₹1-5 crores valuation
- Market-based adjustments

**Growth Stage**:
- Revenue multiples: 3-10x annual revenue
- Traction-based premiums
- Market opportunity assessment

#### Venture Capital Valuation Example
```
SaaS Company:
Annual Revenue: ₹20 crores
Annual Growth Rate: 100%
Gross Margin: 80%
Customer Metrics: 
- CAC: ₹50,000
- LTV: ₹2,00,000
- LTV/CAC: 4x

Valuation Analysis:
Revenue Multiple: 8x (high growth SaaS)
Base Valuation: ₹160 crores
Growth Premium: +25%
Team Premium: +15%
Market Opportunity: +20%
Final Valuation: ₹216 crores
```

### Special Situations Valuation
