# Lesson 118: Risk Tolerance Assessment

## Understanding Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand. It varies significantly based on:
- Age and investment timeline
- Financial situation and income stability
- Investment knowledge and experience
- Personal comfort with uncertainty
- Investment goals and objectives

## Assessing Your Risk Tolerance

### Financial Assessment
- Current income and job security
- Emergency fund status
- Existing debt levels
- Investment capital available
- Expected future income needs

### Psychological Assessment
- Comfort with market volatility
- Response to investment losses
- Investment timeline flexibility
- Financial stress tolerance
- Decision-making confidence

### Age-Based Risk Guidelines
- **Young investors (20s-30s)**: Higher risk tolerance, longer time horizon
- **Middle-aged (40s-50s)**: Moderate risk, balanced approach
- **Pre-retirement (50s-60s)**: Conservative to moderate risk
- **Retired (60+)**: Conservative approach, capital preservation focus
