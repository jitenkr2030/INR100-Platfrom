## What is a Drawdown?

A drawdown is the decline in portfolio value from a peak to a subsequent trough. It measures the largest loss an investor experiences before the portfolio recovers to its previous high.

### Key Drawdown Concepts

#### Peak and Trough
- **Peak**: Highest portfolio value achieved
- **Trough**: Lowest portfolio value after the peak
- **Drawdown**: (Peak - Trough) / Peak × 100

#### Simple Example
- **Portfolio Peak**: ₹10,00,000
- **Portfolio Trough**: ₹7,00,000
- **Drawdown**: (₹10,00,000 - ₹7,00,000) / ₹10,00,000 × 100 = 30%

### Why Drawdowns Matter

#### Psychological Impact
- **Emotional Stress**: Anxiety during declining periods
- **Decision Pressure**: Temptation to sell at lows
- **Confidence Loss**: Doubt about investment strategy
- **Goal Disruption**: Delayed achievement of financial objectives

#### Financial Impact
- **Opportunity Cost**: Lost time for compounding
- **Recovery Requirement**: Need higher returns to break even
- **Cash Flow Impact**: May need to sell at unfavorable times

## Types of Drawdowns

## Calculating Drawdowns

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### Method 1: Peak-to-Trough
1. **Identify Peaks**: Highest values in time series
2. **Find Troughs**: Lowest values after each peak
3. **Calculate Drawdowns**: (Peak - Trough) / Peak
4. **Find Maximum**: Largest drawdown in period

#### Method 2: Running Drawdown
1. **Start with Peak**: Begin with highest value
2. **Track Current Value**: Compare to peak
3. **Calculate Running Drawdown**: (Peak - Current) / Peak
4. **Reset at New Peaks**: Start fresh calculation

### Drawdown Calculation Example

**Monthly Portfolio Values:**
- Jan: ₹10,00,000 (Peak)
- Feb: ₹9,50,000 (-5% drawdown)
- Mar: ₹9,00,000 (-10% drawdown)
- Apr: ₹8,50,000 (-15% drawdown)
- May: ₹9,00,000 (-10% drawdown)
- Jun: ₹9,50,000 (-5% drawdown)
- Jul: ₹10,50,000 (New Peak)
- Aug: ₹10,00,000 (-4.8% drawdown)

**Analysis:**
- **Maximum Drawdown**: 15% (Apr)
- **Current Drawdown**: 4.8% (Aug)
- **Recovery Status**: Recovered from maximum drawdown

### Excel/Google Sheets Formulas

#### Maximum Drawdown Formula
```
=MAX(1-(running_max/A2:A13))
```
Where A2:A13 contains your portfolio values.

#### Running Drawdown Formula
```
=(MAX($A$2:A2)-A2)/MAX($A$2:A2)
```
Copy down for running drawdown calculation.

## Advanced Drawdown Concepts

### 1. Calmar Ratio

#### Definition
Ratio of annual return to maximum drawdown.

#### Formula
**Calmar Ratio = Annual Return / Maximum Drawdown**

#### Interpretation
- **Higher is Better**: More return per unit of drawdown risk
- **Conservative Target**: Calmar ratio > 0.5
- **Aggressive Target**: Calmar ratio > 1.0

#### Example
- **Annual Return**: 12%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: 15%
- **Calmar Ratio**: 12/15 = 0.8 (Good)

### 2. Ulcer Index

#### Definition
Measure of both depth and duration of drawdowns.

#### Components
- **Depth**: How far down from peak
- **Duration**: How long below peak
- **Combined Score**: Overall drawdown pain

#### Interpretation
- **Lower is Better**: Less drawdown pain
- **Quick Recovery**: Better than slow recovery from same depth

### 3. Pain Index

#### Definition
Average of all drawdowns over a period.

#### Formula
**Pain Index = Average of All Drawdowns**

#### Interpretation
