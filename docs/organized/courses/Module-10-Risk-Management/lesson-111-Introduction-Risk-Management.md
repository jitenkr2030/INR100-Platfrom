## What is Investment Risk?

Investment risk refers to the possibility of losing money or not achieving expected returns on your investments. It's the uncertainty about future outcomes and the potential for financial loss.

### Why Risk Management Matters

#### The Reality of Investing
- **No Guaranteed Returns**: All investments carry some risk of loss
- **Volatility is Normal**: Prices fluctuate regularly in financial markets
- **Risk and Return are Connected**: Higher potential returns usually mean higher risk
- **Protection is Essential**: Proper risk management preserves wealth

#### Cost of Poor Risk Management
- **Permanent Loss**: Money that may never be recovered
- **Emotional Stress**: Anxiety and poor decisions during volatility
- **Goal Failure**: Inability to achieve financial objectives
- **Opportunity Cost**: Missing better investment opportunities

## Types of Investment Risks

### 1. Market Risk (Systematic Risk)

#### Definition
Risk that affects the entire market or large segments of it, cannot be eliminated through diversification.

#### Examples
- **Economic Recession**: Entire market decline
- **Interest Rate Changes**: Affect all interest-sensitive investments
- **Political Events**: Elections, policy changes, international conflicts
- **Global Events**: Pandemic, wars, natural disasters

#### Impact on Indian Investors
- **Budget Announcements**: Policy changes affecting markets
- **Global Events**: US Fed rates, China slowdown, oil prices
- **Political Stability**: Government policies and elections

### 2. Company-Specific Risk (Unsystematic Risk)

#### Definition
Risk that affects individual companies or specific sectors, can be reduced through diversification.

#### Types
- **Management Risk**: Poor leadership decisions
- **Business Risk**: Competition, technological changes
- **Financial Risk**: High debt levels, cash flow problems
- **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in industry regulations

#### Examples
- **Company Bankruptcy**: Satyam Computer Services (2009)
- **Management Scams**: Yes Bank governance issues
- **Technology Disruption**: Nokia's decline in mobile phones
- **Regulatory Action**: RBI action on specific banks

### 3. Inflation Risk

#### Definition
The risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your returns.

#### How Inflation Affects Investments
- **Fixed Returns**: Fixed deposits may not keep pace with inflation
- **Real Returns**: Returns after accounting for inflation
- **Time Horizon Impact**: Long-term investments more affected

#### Indian Inflation Context
- **Historical Average**: 6-8% annually
- **Current Levels**: RBI targets around 4% ± 2%
- **Impact on Savings**: Money in savings accounts loses value over time

### 4. Liquidity Risk

The risk of not being able to sell an investment quickly without significant price concession.

#### Examples

### 5. Currency Risk

- **Overseas Education**: Cost fluctuations for foreign education

### 6. Interest Rate Risk

#### Definition
Risk from changes in interest rates affecting bond prices and interest-sensitive stocks.

#### Bond Price Relationship
- **Rate Increase**: Bond prices fall
- **Rate Decrease**: Bond prices rise
- **Duration Risk**: Longer-term bonds more sensitive to rate changes

#### Examples in India
- **Government Bond Yields**: RBI policy rate changes
- **Corporate Bonds**: Company borrowing costs
- **Bank Stocks**: Sensitive to interest rate changes

### 7. Concentration Risk

#### Definition
Risk from having too much money in a single investment or asset class.

- **Single Sector**: All investments in technology
- **Single Geography**: All investments in one country
- **Single Strategy**: Only growth stocks or only value stocks

## Risk-Return Relationship

### The Fundamental Principle

#### Basic Relationship
- **Higher Risk**: Potential for higher returns and higher losses
- **Lower Risk**: More stable returns with lower growth potential
- **No Risk**: Very low returns (savings accounts, government bonds)

#### Risk-Return Spectrum

| Investment Type | Risk Level | Expected Return | Examples |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Ultra Low** | Very Low | 3-6% | Savings Account, PPF |
| **Low** | Low | 6-9% | Government Bonds, Fixed Deposits |
| **Moderate** | Medium | 9-12% | Large Cap Mutual Funds, Corporate Bonds |
| **High** | High | 12-18% | Mid/Small Cap Funds, Sectoral Funds |
| **Very High** | Very High | 18%+ | Individual Stocks, Thematic Funds |

### Understanding Risk Tolerance

#### Personal Risk Tolerance Factors
- **Age**: Younger investors can take more risk
- **Income**: Stable income allows higher risk-taking
- **Financial Goals**: Timeline affects risk capacity
- **Experience**: Investment knowledge and comfort level
- **Psychology**: Emotional ability to handle volatility

#### Risk Capacity vs Risk Willingness
- **Risk Capacity**: How much risk you can financially afford
- **Risk Willingness**: How much risk you're emotionally comfortable with
- **Conservative Approach**: Use the lower of the two
