## What is Volatility?

Volatility refers to the degree of variation in the price or value of an investment over time. High volatility means large price swings, while low volatility means more stable, predictable prices.

### Understanding Price Movements

#### Daily Price Fluctuations
- **Normal Markets**: Small daily changes (±1-2%)
- **Volatile Markets**: Larger daily changes (±3-5%)
- **Extreme Volatility**: Very large daily changes (±10%+)

#### Real-World Example: Market Volatility
**Sensex Daily Movements:**
- **Normal Day**: Sensex moves ±150-300 points (0.5-1%)
- **Volatile Day**: Sensex moves ±500-1000 points (2-3%)
- **Extreme Day**: Sensex moves ±2000+ points (5%+)

### Why Volatility Matters

#### For Investors
- **Emotional Impact**: Causes stress and anxiety
- **Decision Making**: Leads to poor timing decisions
- **Performance**: Affects short-term returns
- **Goal Achievement**: Can derail long-term plans

#### For Investment Planning
