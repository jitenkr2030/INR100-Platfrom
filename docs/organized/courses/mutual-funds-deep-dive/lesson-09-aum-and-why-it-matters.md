# Lesson 9: AUM and Why It Matters

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- What Assets Under Management (AUM) means and how it's calculated
- The relationship between AUM and fund performance
- How AUM affects fund operations and investor experience
- Optimal AUM ranges for different fund categories
- When to be concerned about fund size
- How AUM impacts costs and returns

## What is Assets Under Management (AUM)?

**Assets Under Management (AUM)** is the total market value of all investments managed by a mutual fund scheme. It represents the total money invested by all investors in the fund at a given point in time.

### Simple Definition:
```
AUM = Total Number of Outstanding Units × Current NAV
```

### Key Components:
- **Investor Money**: All investments made by unit holders
- **Market Value**: Current value based on market prices
- **Growth**: Includes capital appreciation and new investments
- **Redemptions**: Decreases when investors sell units

## How AUM is Calculated

### Basic AUM Calculation

#### **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
```
Fund Data:
- Outstanding Units: 50,00,00,000 (50 crore units)
- Current NAV: ₹150.00

AUM Calculation:
AUM = Outstanding Units × Current NAV
AUM = 50,00,00,000 × ₹150
AUM = ₹7,50,00,00,000
AUM = ₹7,500 crore
```

### Real Example: HDFC Large Cap Fund

#### **Monthly AUM Movement**:
```
Month 1:
- Beginning AUM: ₹42,500 crore
- New Investments: ₹800 crore
- Redemptions: ₹600 crore
- Market Appreciation: ₹400 crore
- Ending AUM: ₹43,100 crore

AUM Change = New Investments - Redemptions + Market Change
AUM Change = ₹800 - ₹600 + ₹400 = ₹600 crore
```

#### **AUM Growth Components**:
```
Total AUM Growth: ₹600 crore

1. Net New Money: ₹200 crore (₹800 - ₹600)
   - Fresh investments: ₹800 crore
   - Redemptions: ₹600 crore

2. Market Appreciation: ₹400 crore
   - Stock price increases: ₹400 crore
   - NAV increased from ₹142.50 to ₹143.75

Breakdown:
- Net Flows: 33% of growth
- Market Appreciation: 67% of growth
```

## Types of AUM

### 1. **Gross AUM**

#### **Definition**: Total assets before any deductions

#### **Components**:
```
Gross AUM = Cash + Securities + Receivables
- Market value of all holdings
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Accrued income and receivables
- No deductions for expenses or liabilities
```

### 2. **Net AUM**

#### **Definition**: AUM after deducting fund expenses and liabilities

#### **Calculation**:
```
Net AUM = Gross AUM - Fund Expenses - Liabilities
- Management fees payable
- Administrative expenses
- Outstanding liabilities
- Tax provisions
```

### 3. **Regular vs Direct Plan AUM**

#### **Separate Tracking**:
```
Total Fund AUM: ₹50,000 crore

Breakdown by Plan:
- Regular Plan: ₹35,000 crore (70%)
- Direct Plan: ₹15,000 crore (30%)

AUM by Plan Type:
Regular Plan AUM = ₹35,000 crore
Direct Plan AUM = ₹15,000 crore
Total = ₹50,000 crore
```

## AUM Categories and Classifications

### By Fund Size

#### **Equity Funds AUM Classification**:
```
Micro Cap: <₹100 crore
Small Cap: ₹100-500 crore
Mid Cap: ₹500-2,000 crore
Large Cap: ₹2,000-10,000 crore
Mega Cap: >₹10,000 crore
```

#### **Debt Funds AUM Classification**:
```
Tiny: <₹50 crore
Small: ₹50-200 crore
Medium: ₹200-1,000 crore
Large: ₹1,000-5,000 crore
Mega: >₹5,000 crore
```

### By Growth Stage

#### **Growth Trajectory**:
```
Launch Phase (0-2 years):
- AUM: ₹10-500 crore
- High growth potential
- Building investor base

Growth Phase (2-5 years):
- AUM: ₹500-5,000 crore
- Steady investor acceptance
- Market positioning

Mature Phase (5+ years):

```

## AUM Impact on Fund Performance

### 1. **Economies of Scale**

#### **Cost Benefits of Large AUM**:
```
Fixed Cost Spread Example:

Annual Fixed Costs: ₹2 crore
These costs include:
- Fund manager salary
- Research team costs
- Technology infrastructure
- Compliance expenses

Impact on Different Fund Sizes:

Small Fund (₹100 crore AUM):
Fixed Cost % = ₹2 ÷ ₹100 = 2.0%

Large Fund (₹10,000 crore AUM):
Fixed Cost % = ₹2 ÷ ₹10,000 = 0.02%

Cost Advantage: 1.98% annually
```

#### **Operational Efficiency**:
```
Large Fund Benefits:
1. Better Research:
   - Access to premium data sources
   - Bigger research team
   - Better analytics tools

2. Technology:
   - Advanced trading systems
   - Better risk management
   - Improved investor services

3. Market Access:
   - Better deals from brokers
   - Preferential treatment
   - Lower transaction costs
```

### 2. **Investment Capacity**

#### **Large Fund Advantages**:
```
Investment Benefits:
1. Better Diversification:
   - Can invest in more stocks
   - Lower concentration risk
   - Better sector representation

2. Market Impact:
   - Can influence stock prices
   - Better execution in large trades
   - Access to management teams

3. Stability:
   - Lower impact from individual redemptions
   - More stable NAV
   - Better liquidity management
```

#### **Example: Investment Capacity**:
```
Small Fund (₹200 crore AUM):
- Single stock limit (10%): ₹20 crore
- Can buy: Maximum ₹20 crore in one stock
- Diversification: Limited to 20-25 stocks
- Market impact: High for small-cap stocks

Large Fund (₹10,000 crore AUM):
- Single stock limit (10%): ₹1,000 crore
- Can buy: Maximum ₹1,000 crore in one stock
- Diversification: 50-100 stocks possible
- Market impact: Can move large-cap stocks
```

### 3. **Performance Impact**

#### **Research vs AUM Relationship**:
```
Fund Performance by AUM Size:

Very Small Funds (<₹100 crore):
- Limited research capabilities
- Higher expense ratios
- Higher volatility
- Performance: Variable

Medium Funds (₹1,000-5,000 crore):
- Adequate research team
- Economies of scale
- Good infrastructure
- Performance: Generally good

Large Funds (>₹5,000 crore):
- Excellent research
- Maximum scale benefits
- Strong systems
- Performance: Consistent but may plateau
```

## AUM and Fund Management Challenges

### 1. **Alpha Generation Difficulty**

#### **Why Large Funds Struggle to Outperform**:
```
Market Impact Costs:
Large Fund (₹10,000 crore):
- Buying ₹100 crore in a stock = 1% of AUM
- Market impact: Significant price movement
- Execution costs: Higher
- Alpha generation: Difficult

Small Fund (₹500 crore):
- Buying ₹50 crore in a stock = 10% of AUM
- Market impact: Manageable
- Execution costs: Lower
- Alpha generation: Easier
```

#### **Performance Plateau Effect**:
```
Fund Performance vs AUM Growth:

Fund A Performance:
AUM ₹100 crore: Return 18%
AUM ₹1,000 crore: Return 16%
AUM ₹5,000 crore: Return 14%
AUM ₹10,000 crore: Return 13%

Reason: 
- Difficulty in deploying large amounts
- Higher market impact costs
- Limited opportunities for large positions
- Need to hold more diversified portfolio
```

### 2. **Style Drift**

#### **AUM Pressure Leading to Style Changes**:
```
Large Fund Constraints:

Original Style: Small cap focused
Challenge: Not enough quality small caps for ₹10,000 crore
Pressure: Need to move to larger caps
Result: Style drift from small to large cap

Examples:
- Small cap fund becomes mid cap fund
- Value fund becomes blend fund
- Sector fund becomes diversified fund
```

### 3. **Liquidity Management**

#### **Large Fund Liquidity Challenges**:
```
Redemption Management:

Large Fund (₹10,000 crore):
- Daily redemptions: ₹100-200 crore
- Need to maintain: ₹500-1,000 crore cash
- Market impact: Selling large quantities affects prices
- Challenge: Manage redemptions without affecting portfolio

Small Fund (₹500 crore):
- Daily redemptions: ₹5-10 crore
- Need to maintain: ₹25-50 crore cash
- Market impact: Minimal from redemptions
- Challenge: Easier liquidity management
```

## Optimal AUM Ranges

Equity Mid/Small Cap Funds:
- Minimum: ₹300 crore (viability)
- Optimal: ₹1,000-3,000 crore (balance)

- Above ₹10,000 crore: Alpha generation difficulty

Thematic/Sectoral Funds:
- Optimal Range: ₹500-2,000 crore
- Reason: Limited universe of investible stocks
- Higher AUM: Difficult to maintain thematic purity

Multi Cap/Flexicap Funds:
- Optimal Range: ₹2,000-10,000 crore
- Reason: Large investible universe
- Can handle larger AUM without style drift
