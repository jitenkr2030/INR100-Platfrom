User A sends 1 Bitcoin to User B:
1. User A creates transaction: "Send 1 BTC to User B"
2. Network validates: Is User A's signature valid? Does User A own 1 BTC?
3. Transaction added to block with other valid transactions
4. Block added to blockchain after network consensus
5. User B now owns 1 Bitcoin, transaction permanently recorded
```
