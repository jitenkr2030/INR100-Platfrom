## What is a Pump-and-Dump Scheme?

A pump-and-dump is a form of market manipulation where fraudsters artificially inflate (pump) a stock's price through false or misleading statements, then sell (dump) their shares at the inflated price, leaving other investors with worthless stock.

### How the Scheme Works

#### Phase 1: Accumulation (Silent Phase)
1. **Select target stock**: Usually low-priced, thinly traded stocks
2. **Accumulate shares quietly**: Build position without drawing attention
3. **Spread rumors**: Begin spreading positive news (sometimes false)

#### Phase 2: Promotion (Pump Phase)
1. **Create buzz**: Use social media, forums, messaging apps
2. **False claims**: Make unrealistic promises about growth
3. **Pressure tactics**: "Act now before it's too late!"
4. **Artificial volume**: Coordinate buying to create volume spike

#### Phase 3: Dump Phase
1. **Sell shares**: Fraudsters exit their positions at peak prices
2. **Stock crashes**: Price falls dramatically when selling stops
3. **Victims left holding**: Retail investors lose most of their money

## Modern Pump-and-Dump Tactics

### 1. **Social Media Manipulation**
- **WhatsApp groups**: "Insider tips" from unknown sources
- **Telegram channels**: Daily "hot stock" recommendations
- **Facebook groups**: Influencer endorsements without disclosure
- **Twitter**: Coordinated tweet campaigns using hashtags

### 2. **Paid Promoters**
- **Micro-influencers**: Social media personalities with small followings
- **Fake testimonials**: Paid actors posing as successful investors
- **Affiliate programs**: People get paid for promoting specific stocks
- **SEO manipulation**: Creating fake news websites for search results

### 3. **Online Forums and Chat Rooms**
- **Stock forums**: Paid posters pushing specific stocks
- **Chat rooms**: Anonymous "experts" giving advice
- **Reddit manipulation**: Coordinated upvote campaigns
- **Discord servers**: Private groups for "exclusive" tips

## Warning Signs of Pump-and-Dump Schemes

### 🚩 **Unusual Price Movement**
- **Sudden spikes**: Stock price increases 50-200% in days
- **High volume**: Unusual trading volume without news
- **Thin trading**: Low liquidity makes manipulation easier
- **Reverse correlation**: Stock rises while market falls

### 🚩 **Promotion Patterns**
- **Coordinated campaigns**: Same message across multiple platforms
- **New accounts**: Recently created social media profiles promoting stock
- **Lack of substance**: Promotion without detailed analysis
- **Emotional language**: Use of words like "guaranteed," "secret," "last chance"

### 🚩 **Suspicious Claims**
- **Insider information**: "We have connections inside the company"
- **Guaranteed returns**: Promises of specific percentage gains
- **Time pressure**: "This opportunity won't last long"
- **Exclusive access**: "Only for select investors"

### 🚩 **Red Flags in Promoters**
- **Anonymous promoters**: People hiding their identity
- **No credentials**: Cannot verify their expertise
- **Pushy behavior**: Aggressive tactics to get you to invest
- **Multiple accounts**: Same person using different profiles

## Real Examples of Pump-and-Dump Schemes

- **Result**: Stock rose from ₹3 to ₹45 in 2 weeks

#### The Dump
- **Week 3**: Fraudsters sold all their shares

- **Victims**: Retail investors lost 90%+ of their investment

#### Lessons Learned
1. **No news, no growth**: Company had no actual developments

3. **Volume spike was artificial**: Coordinated buying by fraudsters

### Case Study 2: The "Crypto Pump"

#### The Scam
- **Target**: New cryptocurrency with no real use case

- **Pressure**: "Limited time offer - buy now or miss out!"

#### The Result
- **Initial pump**: Price increased 500% in one week
