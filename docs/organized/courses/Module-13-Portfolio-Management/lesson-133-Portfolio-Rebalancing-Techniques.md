# Lesson 133: Portfolio Rebalancing Techniques

## What is Portfolio Rebalancing?

Portfolio rebalancing is the process of realigning portfolio weights back to target allocations by buying or selling assets. It ensures:
- Maintains desired risk level
- Enforces discipline to buy low, sell high
- Controls portfolio drift
- Manages concentration risk

## Types of Rebalancing

### Calendar-Based Rebalancing
#### Annual Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Once per year
- **Advantages**: Simple, low cost, disciplined
- **Disadvantages**: May miss significant drifts
- **Best For**: Long-term, hands-off investors

#### Quarterly Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Four times per year
- **Advantages**: More responsive to changes
- **Disadvantages**: Higher transaction costs
- **Best For**: Active investors, volatile markets

#### Monthly Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Twelve times per year
- **Advantages**: Maintains tight control
- **Disadvantages**: High costs, tax inefficiency
- **Best For**: Professional managers, institutional

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing
#### Absolute Threshold
- **5% Rule**: Rebalance when allocation drifts 5%
- **10% Rule**: Less frequent adjustments
- **Volatility-Based**: Adjust thresholds by asset class

#### Relative Threshold
- **Percentage Drift**: 20% drift from target
- **Proportional Rebalancing**: Rebalance proportionally
- **Risk Budgeting**: Rebalance based on risk contribution

## Rebalancing Strategies

### Full Rebalancing
- **Process**: Sell overweight assets, buy underweight
- **Advantages**: Maintains exact target allocation
- **Disadvantages**: High transaction costs
- **Best For**: Small portfolios, tax-advantaged accounts

### Partial Rebalancing
- **Process**: Only partially adjust to targets
- **Advantages**: Lower costs, tax efficient
- **Disadvantages**: Gradual adjustment to targets
- **Best For**: Taxable accounts, cost-conscious investors

### Systematic Rebalancing
- **Process**: Use systematic investment plans
- **Advantages**: Automatic, disciplined
- **Disadvantages**: May not achieve exact targets
- **Best For**: SIP-based portfolios

## Implementation Considerations

### Transaction Costs
#### Brokerage Fees
- **Equity Transactions**: Fixed or percentage-based
- **Mutual Fund Redemptions**: Exit loads, expense ratios
- **Bond Trading**: Bid-ask spreads, commissions
- **ETF Trading**: Creation/redemption costs

#### Market Impact
- **Large Orders**: Can move market prices
- **Illiquid Securities**: Higher impact costs
- **Timing**: Market hours vs after-hours
- **Order Types**: Market vs limit orders

### Tax Considerations
#### Taxable Accounts
- **Capital Gains**: Realize gains when selling
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses
- **Holding Period**: Long-term vs short-term gains

#### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **No Tax Consequences**: IRAs, 401(k)s
- **Efficient Rebalancing**: Rebalance here first
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximize tax benefits
- **Distribution Rules**: Required minimum distributions

## Advanced Rebalancing Techniques

### Risk-Based Rebalancing
#### Volatility Adjustment
- Adjust rebalancing frequency based on volatility
- Higher volatility = more frequent rebalancing
- Use VIX or other volatility measures
- Protect against excessive risk

#### Correlation Rebalancing
- Monitor correlation changes between assets
- Increase rebalancing when correlations rise
- Diversification benefits may disappear
- Adjust allocation based on correlation

### Tactical Rebalancing
#### Market Timing Element
- Use rebalancing to express market views
- Overweight undervalued assets
- Underweight overvalued assets
- Combine strategic and tactical approaches

#### Economic Cycle Adjustment
- **Expansion**: Increase equity allocation
- **Peak**: Reduce growth assets
- **Contraction**: Increase defensive assets
- **Recovery**: Rebalance toward growth
