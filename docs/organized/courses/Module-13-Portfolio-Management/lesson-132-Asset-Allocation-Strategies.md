# Lesson 132: Asset Allocation Strategies

## Understanding Asset Allocation

Asset allocation is the process of dividing investments among different asset categories such as:
- **Equities**: Stocks and equity funds
- **Fixed Income**: Bonds, debt funds
- **Cash**: Savings, money market instruments
- **Alternatives**: Real estate, commodities, gold

## Strategic Asset Allocation

### Core Principles
- Based on long-term investment goals
- Considers risk tolerance and time horizon
- Provides foundation for portfolio construction
- Rebalanced periodically to maintain targets

### Age-Based Allocation Models
#### Conservative (Age 60+)
- 30% Equities
- 60% Fixed Income
- 10% Cash/Alternatives

#### Moderate (Age 40-60)
- 50% Equities
- 40% Fixed Income
- 10% Cash/Alternatives

#### Aggressive (Under 40)
- 70% Equities
- 20% Fixed Income
- 10% Cash/Alternatives

## Tactical Asset Allocation

### Dynamic Adjustment
- Adjust allocation based on market conditions
- Uses economic indicators and market trends
- Adds value through market timing
- Requires active monitoring

### Key Indicators
- **Valuation Metrics**: P/E ratios, P/B ratios
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP growth, inflation
- **Interest Rates**: Bond yield curves
- **Market Sentiment**: Volatility indices

## Modern Portfolio Theory Applications

### Efficient Frontier
- Identifies optimal portfolios
- Maximizes return for given risk level
- Considers correlation between assets
- Provides scientific approach to allocation

### Risk-Return Optimization
- **Mean-Variance Analysis**: Core MPT concept
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Correlation Analysis**: Diversification benefits
- **Standard Deviation**: Risk measurement

## Asset Class Selection

### Domestic Equity Allocation
- **Large Cap**: Stable, blue-chip companies
- **Mid Cap**: Growth potential with moderate risk
- **Small Cap**: High growth, high volatility
- **Sector Allocation**: Industry diversification

### Fixed Income Allocation
- **Government Securities**: Safest option
- **Corporate Bonds**: Higher yield, credit risk
- **Municipal Bonds**: Tax advantages
- **Duration Management**: Interest rate risk

### Alternative Assets
- **Real Estate**: REITs and direct property
- **Commodities**: Gold, silver, oil
- **Private Equity**: Unlisted companies
- **Hedge Funds**: Alternative strategies

## Portfolio Construction Process

### Step 1: Define Objectives
- Investment goals and timeline
- Risk tolerance assessment
- Income requirements
- Tax considerations

### Step 2: Strategic Allocation
- Set target allocation percentages
- Consider correlation between assets
- Account for expected returns and volatility
- Build efficient frontier

### Step 3: Implementation
- Select specific investments
- Consider costs and taxes
- Ensure adequate diversification
- Monitor liquidity needs

### Step 4: Monitoring and Rebalancing
- Regular performance review
- Rebalance to target allocations
- Adjust for life changes
- Optimize tax efficiency

## Rebalancing Strategies

### Calendar-Based Rebalancing
- **Annual Rebalancing**: Simple, systematic
- **Semi-Annual**: More responsive to changes
- **Quarterly**: Frequent adjustment
- Monthly: High maintenance, minimal benefit

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing
- **5% Drift Rule**: Rebalance when allocation drifts 5%
- **Absolute Rules**: Specific percentage thresholds
- **Relative Rules**: Percentage of target allocation
- **Volatility-Based**: Adjust based on market volatility

## Tax-Efficient Allocation

### Asset Location Strategy
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Bonds, REITs
- **Taxable Accounts**: Index funds, ETFs
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses
- **Municipal Bonds**: Tax-free income

### Tax Implications
- **Dividend Taxation**: Qualified vs ordinary
- **Capital Gains**: Long-term vs short-term
- **Interest Income**: Taxable vs tax-free
- **Alternative Investments**: Special tax treatment

## International Diversification

### Global Asset Allocation
- **Developed Markets**: US, Europe, Japan
- **Emerging Markets**: Higher growth potential
- **Frontier Markets**: Highest risk/reward
- **Currency Considerations**: Hedging strategies

### Regional Allocation
- **Asia-Pacific**: Growth markets
- **Europe**: Developed market exposure
- **Americas**: US market focus
- **Global Themes**: Technology, healthcare, ESG

## Risk Management in Allocation

### Concentration Risk
- **Single Security Limits**: Maximum 5-10% per stock
- **Sector Limits**: Maximum 20-25% per sector
- **Geographic Limits**: Regional diversification
- **Asset Class Limits**: Minimum allocation requirements

### Correlation Monitoring
- **Regular Analysis**: Track correlation changes
- **Stress Testing**: Test portfolio under stress
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Modify allocation for correlation shifts
- **Risk Budgeting**: Allocate risk across asset classes

## Performance Measurement

### Benchmark Selection
- **Asset Class Benchmarks**: Appropriate indices
- **Custom Benchmarks**: Match portfolio composition
- **Peer Comparison**: Similar portfolio strategies
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, alpha

### Attribution Analysis
- **Asset Allocation Effect**: Strategic vs tactical
- **Security Selection Effect**: Individual stock picking
- **Interaction Effects**: Combined allocation and selection
- **Timing Effects**: Market timing contributions

## Common Allocation Mistakes

### Behavioral Errors
- **Home Bias**: Overweighting domestic assets
- **Recency Bias**: Recent performance influence
- **Anchoring**: Sticking to initial allocation
- **Overconfidence**: Taking excessive risk

### Technical Mistakes
- **Inadequate Diversification**: Too concentrated
- **Ignoring Correlation**: False diversification
- **Neglecting Rebalancing**: Drift from targets
- **Tax Inefficiency**: Poor asset location

## Key Takeaways
- Asset allocation is the primary driver of returns
- Strategic allocation provides long-term framework
- Tactical allocation can add value through timing
- Regular rebalancing maintains target allocation
- Tax efficiency improves net returns
- Risk management is crucial for long-term success
