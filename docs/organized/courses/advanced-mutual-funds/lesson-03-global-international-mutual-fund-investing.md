## Currency Risk and Management

### Understanding Currency Risk
**Definition**: Risk from exchange rate fluctuations affecting international investment returns
**Impact**: Can significantly affect total returns for international investments
**Calculation**: Total Return = Local Market Return + Currency Return + Interaction Effect

### Currency Impact Example
```
Investment Scenario:
US Investor investing in European stocks

Initial Investment: $100,000
Exchange Rate: 1 EUR = 1.10 USD
European Investment: €90,909

After 1 Year:
European Stock Return: +15%
Exchange Rate: 1 EUR = 1.05 USD (EUR weakened)

Local Market Return: €90,909 × 1.15 = €104,545
USD Value: €104,545 × 1.05 = $109,772
Total Return: 9.77%

Breakdown:
Local Market Return: +15%
Currency Return: -4.5%
Total Return: +9.77%
```

### Currency Risk Management Strategies

#### 1. **Natural Hedging**
**Approach**: Match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities
**Implementation**: 
- Foreign currency income to fund foreign investments
- Matching currency of expenses with investments
- Using foreign currency savings for foreign investments

#### 2. **Systematic Hedging**
**Approach**: Hedge currency exposure systematically
**Methods**:
- Forward contracts for known currency exposure
- Currency hedging ratios (e.g., hedge 50% of foreign exposure)
- Dynamic hedging based on currency forecasts

#### 3. **Hedge Ratio Strategies**
**Full Hedging (100%)**: Eliminate all currency risk
**Partial Hedging (50-75%)**: Reduce but not eliminate currency risk
**No Hedging**: Accept full currency exposure
**Dynamic Hedging**: Adjust hedge ratio based on currency outlook

### Currency Hedged Funds
**Structure**: Fund automatically hedges currency exposure
**Benefits**: Removes currency risk, predictable returns
**Costs**: Hedging costs reduce returns
**Suitable For**: Investors with home currency liabilities

**Example Hedged Fund Performance**:
```
European Investment (Unhedged):
Local Return: +12%
Currency Return: -3%
Total Return: +8.7%

Local Return: +12%
Hedging Cost: -0.5%
Total Return: +11.5%
