## Core Content

### 1. Introduction to Advanced Portfolio Construction

Portfolio construction is the systematic process of combining different assets to achieve specific investment objectives while managing risk. Advanced portfolio construction goes beyond simple diversification to include optimization techniques, risk budgeting, and sophisticated rebalancing strategies.

**Key Principle**: "Portfolio construction is more important than individual security selection in determining long-term returns"

### 2. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Foundation

**Practical Application:**
- Identify optimal portfolios along efficient frontier
- Select portfolio based on risk tolerance
- Understand trade-offs between risk and return
- Regular rebalancing to maintain efficiency

**Kelly Criterion Application:**
```
f = (bp - q) / b
Where: f = fraction of capital to bet
