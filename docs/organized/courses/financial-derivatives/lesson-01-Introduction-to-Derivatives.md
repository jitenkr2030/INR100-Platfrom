## What are Financial Derivatives?

Financial derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, index, or rate. They are contracts between two or more parties that specify conditions under which payments are to be made between them.

### Key Characteristics of Derivatives
1. **Derivative Nature**: Value depends on underlying asset
2. **Contractual Agreement**: Legal obligations between parties
3. **Leverage**: Control large positions with relatively small capital
4. **Standardization**: Most derivatives are standardized contracts
5. **Trading Venues**: Exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC)

## Types of Financial Derivatives

### 1. Options
Contracts giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specified price before or at a certain date.

**Call Options**: Right to buy the underlying asset
**Put Options**: Right to sell the underlying asset

**Example**: 
- Stock ABC trading at $100
- Call option with strike price $105 costs $3
- Buyer has right to buy ABC at $105 until expiration

### 2. Futures Contracts
Standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date.

**Characteristics**:
- **Obligation**: Both parties must fulfill the contract
- **Standardized**: Exchange-traded with fixed specifications
- **Margin Requirements**: Initial and maintenance margins required

**Example**:
- Gold futures contract for December delivery at $2,000/oz
- Buyer agrees to purchase 100 ounces of gold at $2,000 in December

### 3. Forward Contracts
Customized agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date.

**Differences from Futures**:
- **Customized**: Terms negotiated between parties
- **OTC Trading**: Not traded on exchanges
- **No Daily Settlement**: Settlement occurs at maturity

### 4. Swaps
Agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows or other financial instruments.

**Common Types**:
- **Interest Rate Swaps**: Fixed for floating interest rate exchanges
- **Currency Swaps**: Exchange principal and interest in different currencies
- **Credit Default Swaps**: Insurance against credit events

### 5. Structured Products
Complex derivatives combining multiple financial instruments to achieve specific investment objectives.

**Examples**:
- **Principal Protected Notes**: Capital protection with upside participation
- **Barrier Options**: Options that activate or deactivate based on price levels
- **Basket Options**: Options on portfolios of underlying assets

## Purpose and Uses of Derivatives

### 1. Hedging
Using derivatives to reduce or eliminate risk from adverse price movements.

**Example**: 
- Farmer growing wheat concerns about price drops
- Sells wheat futures to lock in selling price
- Protects against price decline while maintaining upside if prices rise

### 2. Speculation
Using derivatives to profit from anticipated price movements.

**Example**:
- Trader believes oil prices will rise
- Buys oil futures contracts
- Profits if prices increase, loses if prices decrease

### 3. Arbitrage
Profiting from price differences between related instruments or markets.

**Example**:
- Stock trading at $100 on NYSE and $102 on LSE
- Buy on NYSE, sell on LSE for $2 profit
- Requires fast execution and low transaction costs

### 4. Risk Management
Using derivatives to modify risk profiles and optimize portfolio performance.

**Portfolio Applications**:
- **Beta Adjustment**: Using futures to change portfolio beta
- **Duration Management**: Using interest rate derivatives to adjust bond duration
- **Currency Hedging**: Protecting against foreign exchange risk
