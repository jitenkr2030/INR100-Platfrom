#### Types of Retirement Goals
- **Basic Needs**: Housing, food, healthcare, utilities
- **Lifestyle Goals**: Travel, hobbies, entertainment
- **Legacy Goals**: Wealth transfer, charitable giving
- **Healthcare Goals**: Medical expenses, long-term care

#### Retirement Lifestyle Categories

- **Comfortable Retirement**: Moderate lifestyle with some luxuries
- **Affluent Retirement**: Premium lifestyle with extensive travel
- **Luxury Retirement**: High-end lifestyle with multiple properties

## Retirement Need Assessment

### Current Expense Analysis
**Step 1: Calculate Current Monthly Expenses**
- **Housing**: Rent/mortgage, property taxes, maintenance
- **Food**: Groceries, dining out, beverages
- **Transportation**: Fuel, vehicle maintenance, public transport
- **Healthcare**: Insurance premiums, medical expenses
- **Utilities**: Electricity, water, gas, internet, phone
- **Personal Care**: Clothing, grooming, fitness
- **Entertainment**: Movies, subscriptions, hobbies
- **Miscellaneous**: Gifts, donations, emergency expenses

**Step 2: Adjust for Inflation**
**Inflation Adjustment Formula**:
**Adjusted Expense = Current Expense × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years**

**Example Calculation**:
- Current monthly expenses: ₹50,000
- Annual inflation: 6%
- Years to retirement: 25 years
- **Future expenses**: ₹50,000 × (1.06)^25 = ₹2,14,000

### Retirement Corpus Calculation

#### Simple Approach
**Retirement Corpus = Annual Retirement Expenses × 25**

**Example**:
- Annual expenses: ₹25,00,000 (₹2,14,000 × 12)
- **Required corpus**: ₹25,00,000 × 25 = ₹6,25,00,000

#### Scientific Approach (Monte Carlo Analysis)
**Formula**: 
**Future Value of Retirement Corpus = Σ(Annual Savings × (1+r)^n) - Current Corpus × (1+r)^n**

Where:
- r = Expected annual return
- n = Years to retirement

**Example Calculation**:
- Current age: 35, Retirement age: 60
- Years to retirement: 25
- Expected return: 10%
- Annual savings needed: ₹4,00,000
- **Future corpus**: ₹39,97,000 + existing corpus growth

### 4% Withdrawal Rule
**Principle**: Withdraw 4% of retirement corpus annually for sustainable income

**Calculation**:
- Required annual income: ₹25,00,000
- **Required corpus**: ₹25,00,000 ÷ 0.04 = ₹6,25,00,000

**Adjustments for Indian Context**:
- **Inflation**: Higher inflation requires higher corpus
- **Healthcare**: Rising medical costs need additional planning
- **Longevity**: Longer life expectancy increases corpus needs
