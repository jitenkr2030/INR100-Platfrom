### Analysis Methodologies

#### Horizontal Analysis
**Trend Analysis**: Comparing financial data over multiple periods
```
Percentage Change Formula:
% Change = [(Current Year - Base Year) / Base Year] × 100

Absolute Change Formula:
Absolute Change = Current Year - Base Year
```

**Example - Revenue Growth**:
```
Year 2021: ₹100 crores
Year 2022: ₹125 crores
Year 2023: ₹150 crores

Percentage Changes:
2022 vs 2021: [(125-100)/100] × 100 = 25%
2023 vs 2022: [(150-125)/125] × 100 = 20%
```

#### Vertical Analysis (Common Size Statements)
**Purpose**: Express each line item as a percentage of a base figure
**Income Statement Base**: Total Revenue
**Balance Sheet Base**: Total Assets

**Common Size Income Statement Example**:
```
                     ₹ Crores    Percentage
Revenue              1,000       100.0%

Interest              20         2.0%
Tax                   40         4.0%
Net Profit            90         9.0%

### Financial Forecasting Methods

#### Top-Down Forecasting
**Market-Based Approach**:
```
Market Analysis:
Total Market Size: ₹10,000 crores
Market Growth Rate: 8%
Company Market Share: 10%

Forecast Calculation:
Year 1: ₹10,000 × 8% × 10% = ₹800 crores
Year 2: ₹10,800 × 8% × 10% = ₹864 crores
Year 3: ₹11,664 × 8% × 10% = ₹933 crores
```

#### Bottom-Up Forecasting
**Customer-Based Approach**:
```
Customer Analysis:
Number of Customers: 10,000
Average Revenue per Customer: ₹80,000
Growth in Customer Base: 20%
Revenue per Customer Growth: 10%

Forecast:
Year 1: 10,000 × ₹80,000 × 1.2 × 1.1 = ₹1,056 crores
Year 2: 12,000 × ₹88,000 × 1.2 × 1.1 = ₹1,389 crores
```

#### Regression Analysis
**Simple Linear Regression**:
```
Revenue vs. GDP Growth:
Data Points:
GDP Growth: 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%
Revenue Growth: 8%, 10%, 12%, 14%

Regression Equation:
Revenue Growth = 3 + 1.5 × GDP Growth

Forecast (GDP Growth = 7%):
Revenue Growth = 3 + 1.5 × 7 = 13.5%

## Advanced Analytical Techniques

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

#### EVA Calculation
**Formula**:
```
EVA = NOPAT - (WACC × Capital Employed)

Where:
NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax
WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital
Capital Employed = Total Assets - Current Liabilities

Calculation:
NOPAT: ₹112.5 crores
WACC: 12%
Capital Employed: ₹400 crores
EVA = ₹112.5 - (12% × ₹400) = ₹112.5 - ₹48 = ₹64.5 crores
```

**EVA Components**:
```
NOPAT Calculation:
Operating Profit: ₹150 crores
Tax Rate: 25%
Tax on Operating Profit: ₹37.5 crores
NOPAT: ₹150 - ₹37.5 = ₹112.5 crores
```

#### EVA Interpretation
**Value Creation**:
- EVA > 0: Company creates value
- EVA < 0: Company destroys value
- EVA = 0: Company breaks even

**Trend Analysis**:
```
EVA Trend:
Year 1: ₹45 crores
Year 2: ₹52 crores
Year 3: ₹64.5 crores
Trend: Improving value creation
```

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

#### ROIC Analysis
**Formula**:
```
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital

Invested Capital Components:
Total Assets: ₹500 crores
Less: Current Liabilities: ₹100 crores
Less: Excess Cash: ₹20 crores
Invested Capital: ₹380 crores

ROIC = ₹112.5 / ₹380 = 29.6%
```

**ROIC vs. WACC**:
```
ROIC: 29.6%
WACC: 12%
Spread: 17.6%

Interpretation:
- ROIC > WACC: Positive value creation
- Higher spread indicates stronger competitive advantage
```

### Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI)

#### CFROI Calculation
**Formula**:
```
CFROI = Gross Cash Flow / Gross Investment

Where:
Gross Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation + Interest
Gross Investment = Total Assets + Accumulated Depreciation

Calculation:
Net Income: ₹90 crores
Depreciation: ₹30 crores
Interest: ₹30 crores
Gross Cash Flow: ₹150 crores

Total Assets: ₹500 crores
Accumulated Depreciation: ₹120 crores
Gross Investment: ₹620 crores

CFROI = 150 / 620 = 24.2%
```

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Analysis

#### P/E Ratio Components
**P/E Ratio Calculation**:
```
P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share

Earnings per Share:
Net Income: ₹90 crores
Shares Outstanding: 10 crores
EPS: ₹9.0

Market Price: ₹135
P/E Ratio: 135 / 9 = 15.0x
```

**P/E Ratio Analysis**:
```
P/E Components:
Forward P/E: Based on next year's earnings
Trailing P/E: Based on last 12 months earnings
PEG Ratio: P/E / Growth Rate

PEG Analysis:
P/E: 15.0x
Expected Growth: 15%
PEG: 1.0 (fairly valued)
```
