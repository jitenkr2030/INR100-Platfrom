├── Foreign currency loans
├── Foreign subsidiary operations
├── Dividend remittances
└── Royalty and license payments

Exposure Calculation:
Foreign Currency Exposure = FC × Exchange Rate Change Impact

Example:
USD Receivables: $100,000
Current Rate: ₹82.50/USD
Rate Change: +₹2.00/USD
Exposure Impact: $100,000 × ₹2.00 = ₹2,00,000
```

**Translation Exposure**:
```
Translation Exposure:

├── Cash flows
├── Equity items
└── Consolidation impacts

### FX Risk Measurement

#### Value at Risk (VaR) for FX
**FX VaR Calculation**:
```
FX VaR Methodology:
Historical Simulation VaR:

2. Calculate portfolio P&L for each day
3. Sort P&L from worst to best
4. Select appropriate percentile

Parametric VaR (Variance-Covariance):
VaR = μ - Z(α) × σ

Example Calculation:
Currency Exposure:
USD/INR: +$10 million
EUR/INR: -€5 million
GBP/INR: +£3 million

Historical Volatilities:
USD/INR: 12% annually
EUR/INR: 15% annually
GBP/INR: 18% annually

Correlation Matrix:
USD-EUR: 0.65
USD-GBP: 0.70
EUR-GBP: 0.80

Portfolio VaR (95%, 1-day): $2.1 million
```

Hedge Effectiveness:
Without Hedge:
Receivable Value: $1,000,000 × ₹83.50 = ₹8,35,00,000
Spot Rate: ₹82.00/USD
Unhedged Value: ₹8,20,00,000
Gain/Loss: -₹15,00,000

With Hedge:
Forward Contract Value: ₹8,35,00,000
