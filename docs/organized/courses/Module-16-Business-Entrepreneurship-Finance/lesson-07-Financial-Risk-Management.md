├── Liquidity (15%)
└── Cash Flow (10%)

└── Political Risk (5%)

Rating Scale:
AAA: Extremely strong capacity
AA: Very strong capacity
A: Strong capacity
BBB: Adequate capacity
BB: Speculative
B: Highly speculative
CCC: Extremely speculative
```

#### Probability of Default (PD) Models
**Statistical Models**:
```
Logistic Regression:
PD = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

Where z = α + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ

Example Model:
Z = -2.5 + 0.8 × Leverage + 1.2 × Liquidity - 0.6 × Profitability

Calculation:
Leverage = 2.0, Liquidity = 1.5, Profitability = 0.15
Z = -2.5 + 0.8 × 2.0 + 1.2 × 1.5 - 0.6 × 0.15
Z = 0.1
PD = 1 / (1 + e^(-0.1)) = 52.5%
```

#### Expected Loss Calculation
**Loss Components**:
```
Expected Loss (EL) = PD × LGD × EAD

Where:
PD = Probability of Default
LGD = Loss Given Default
EAD = Exposure at Default

Example:
PD = 2%
LGD = 60%
EAD = ₹100 crores
EL = 0.02 × 0.60 × ₹100 = ₹1.2 crores

Unexpected Loss (UL):
UL = √(PD × LGD² × EAD² × σ²)
Where σ² = variance of LGD
```

### Credit Portfolio Management

#### Concentration Risk
**Single Counterparty Limits**:
```
Exposure Limits:
Single Counterparty: 10% of capital
Group Counterparty: 15% of capital

```

**Geographic and Sector Analysis**:
```

By Sector:

```

#### Credit Derivatives
**Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**:
```
CDS Structure:
Protection Buyer: Pays regular premium
Protection Seller: Pays in case of default
Credit Event: Bankruptcy, failure to pay, restructuring

Premium Calculation:
Premium = (PD × LGD) / (1 - Recovery Rate)

Example:
PD = 2%, LGD = 60%, Recovery = 40%
Premium = (0.02 × 0.60) / (1 - 0.40) = 2.0%

### Liquidity Measurement

**Traditional Ratios**:
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities

Example:
Current Assets: ₹500 crores
├── Cash: ₹100 crores
├── Receivables: ₹200 crores
├── Inventory: ₹150 crores
└── Other: ₹50 crores

Current Liabilities: ₹300 crores
Current Ratio = 500 / 300 = 1.67
Quick Ratio = 350 / 300 = 1.17
Cash Ratio = 100 / 300 = 0.33
```

#### Advanced Liquidity Metrics
**Cash Conversion Cycle**:
```
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

Component Analysis:
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):
Accounts Receivable / Daily Sales
= ₹200 crores / (₹1,000 crores / 365) = 73 days

Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):
Inventory / Daily COGS
= ₹150 crores / (₹700 crores / 365) = 78 days

Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):
Accounts Payable / Daily COGS
= ₹100 crores / (₹700 crores / 365) = 52 days

CCC = 73 + 78 - 52 = 99 days
```

```

## Risk Measurement and Modeling

### Value at Risk (VaR)

#### VaR Methodologies
**Historical Simulation VaR**:
```
Historical VaR Process:
1. Collect 250 days of historical returns
2. Sort returns from worst to best
3. Select appropriate percentile
4. Apply to current portfolio

Example Portfolio:
Daily Returns (₹ crores):
-50, -35, -28, -22, -15, -8, 0, 5, 12, 18, 25, 32, 45

95% VaR (5th percentile):
Sorted returns: -50, -35, -28, -22, -15
95% VaR = -35 crores
Interpretation: 5% chance of daily loss > ₹35 crores
```

**Parametric VaR (Variance-Covariance)**:
```
Parametric VaR Formula:
VaR = μ - Z(α) × σ

Where:
μ = Mean return
Z(α) = Z-score for confidence level α
σ = Standard deviation

Example:
Mean return = ₹2 crores
Standard deviation = ₹15 crores
95% confidence level: Z = 1.645
VaR = 2 - 1.645 × 15 = -₹22.7 crores
```

#### Expected Shortfall (ES)
**ES Calculation**:
```
Expected Shortfall Definition:
ES(α) = E[L | L > VaR(α)]

Historical ES Calculation:
Sort losses from worst to best
Calculate VaR threshold
Average all losses worse than VaR

Example:
Loss Distribution: 100, 85, 72, 65, 58, 45, 35, 28, 22, 15, 8, 5, 0
95% VaR = 58 crores
Expected Shortfall = (100 + 85 + 72 + 65 + 58) / 5 = 76 crores
```

├── Cost inflation (+15%)
├── Customer concentration failure
└── Regulatory change impact
```

#### Reverse Stress Testing
**Process Framework**:
```
Reverse Stress Testing Steps:
1. Define failure scenarios
