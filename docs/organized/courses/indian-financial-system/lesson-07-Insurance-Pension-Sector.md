## Introduction

Insurance and pension systems form the protective shield and retirement foundation of personal finance, much like how an umbrella protects against rain and a strong foundation supports a building. Insurance provides protection against financial losses from unforeseen events, while pension systems ensure dignity and security in retirement years. India's insurance and pension sector has evolved from a monopolistic public sector structure to a competitive market with diverse products, innovative services, and increasing penetration across urban and rural areas.

Understanding insurance and pension systems is essential for personal financial planning, risk management, and retirement preparation. Whether you're evaluating life insurance needs, comparing health insurance options, or planning for retirement through various pension schemes, knowledge of these systems provides the foundation for making informed decisions and building long-term financial security.
