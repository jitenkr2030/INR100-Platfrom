## Introduction

Financial regulation serves as the rulebook and referee of the economic game, ensuring fair play, protecting players, and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. India's regulatory framework is like a well-orchestrated symphony, where multiple specialized conductors (regulators) work in harmony to create a stable, efficient, and inclusive financial system. From RBI's monetary policy conduct to SEBI's market oversight, from IRDAI's insurance supervision to PFRDA's pension regulation, each regulator plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability while promoting innovation and growth.

Understanding this regulatory architecture is essential for financial professionals, business leaders, and investors who need to navigate compliance requirements, understand regulatory risks, and appreciate how regulations impact financial decisions and market behavior.
