### Futures Pricing

#### Cost of Carry Model

**Basic Formula**
```
Futures Price = Spot Price + Cost of Carry - Benefit of Carry
```

**Cost of Carry Components**
- **Financing Cost**: Interest on funds to purchase asset
- **Storage Cost**: Cost of storing physical commodities
- **Insurance Cost**: Insurance for asset protection
- **Convenience Yield**: Benefits of holding the physical asset

**Formula Components**
```
F = S × e^(r+u-y)×T
```
Where:
- F = Futures price
- S = Spot price
- r = Risk-free rate
- u = Storage cost rate
- y = Convenience yield rate
- T = Time to expiration

#### Fair Value Calculation

**Stock Index Futures**
```
Fair Value = Spot Index × (1 + r - d)^(T/365)
```
Where:
- r = Risk-free rate (annual)
- d = Dividend yield (annual)
- T = Days to expiration

**Example Calculation**
- **NIFTY Spot**: 19,500
- **Risk-free Rate**: 6.5% (annual)
- **Dividend Yield**: 1.5% (annual)
- **Days to Expiry**: 30
- **Fair Value**: 19,500 × (1 + 0.065 - 0.015)^(30/365) = 19,500 × 1.004 = 19,578

#### Basis and Convergence

**Basis Definition**
```
Basis = Futures Price - Spot Price
```

**Basis Components**
- **Cost of Carry**: Financing, storage, insurance costs
- **Market Sentiment**: Supply and demand imbalances
- **Seasonal Factors**: Commodity-specific seasonal patterns
- **Convenience Yield**: Benefits of physical ownership

**Basis Convergence**
- **Rationale**: Futures and spot prices converge at expiration
- **Arbitrage**: Elimination of arbitrage opportunities
- **Time Decay**: Basis typically decreases over time
- **Delivery Effect**: Physical delivery can influence convergence

### Futures Trading Mechanics

#### Margin System

**Initial Margin**
- **Purpose**: Good faith deposit to enter futures position
- **Amount**: 5-8% of contract value (varies by volatility)
- **Payment**: Cash or eligible securities
- **Return**: Returned when position closed or expired

**Maintenance Margin**
- **Purpose**: Minimum margin level to maintain position
- **Amount**: Typically 75-80% of initial margin
- **Trigger**: Margin call if balance falls below level
- **Top-up**: Additional margin required to restore initial level

**Margin Call Process**
1. **Daily Mark-to-Market**: Settlement at end of each day
2. **Margin Deficit**: Account falls below maintenance margin
3. **Notification**: Broker notifies client of margin call
4. **Response Time**: Typically 24 hours to meet call
5. **Consequences**: Position liquidation if call not met

#### Mark-to-Market

**Daily Settlement Process**
- **Price Discovery**: Closing price determined by exchange
- **Profit/Loss Calculation**: Based on previous day's settlement price
- **Cash Settlement**: Profits credited, losses debited
- **Margin Impact**: Gains can reduce margin requirements

**Example Mark-to-Market**
- **Previous Settlement**: ₹19,500
- **Current Settlement**: ₹19,600
- **Contract Size**: 75 NIFTY
- **Profit**: (19,600 - 19,500) × 75 = ₹7,500 (credited to account)

### Futures Strategies

#### Speculative Strategies

**Long Futures (Bullish Strategy)**
- **Expectation**: Expect underlying price to increase
- **Profit Potential**: Unlimited profit if price rises
- **Loss Potential**: Significant loss if price falls
- **Margin Requirement**: Initial margin must be maintained

**Short Futures (Bearish Strategy)**
- **Expectation**: Expect underlying price to decrease
- **Profit Potential**: Significant profit if price falls
- **Loss Potential**: Unlimited loss if price rises
- **Margin Requirement**: Same as long futures

**Calendar Spreads**
- **Strategy**: Long near-month, short far-month (or vice versa)
- **Expectation**: Expectation of changing futures curve
- **Reduced Risk**: Lower exposure than outright positions
- **Market View**: Expectation of basis changes

#### Hedging Strategies

**Long Hedge (Buying Hedge)**
- **Use Case**: Need to buy underlying asset in future
- **Strategy**: Buy futures contract now
- **Benefit**: Lock in purchase price
- **Risk**: Opportunity cost if prices fall

**Short Hedge (Selling Hedge)**
- **Use Case**: Need to sell underlying asset in future
- **Strategy**: Sell futures contract now
- **Benefit**: Lock in sale price
- **Risk**: Opportunity cost if prices rise

#### Arbitrage Strategies

**Cash and Carry Arbitrage**
- **Process**: Buy spot, sell futures
- **Profit**: When futures overpriced relative to spot
- **Requirements**: Ability to borrow and store asset
- **Risk**: Storage costs, financing costs, basis risk

**Reverse Cash and Carry**
- **Process**: Sell spot, buy futures
- **Profit**: When futures underpriced relative to spot

- **Currencies**: Interest rate differentials determine forward rates

**Consumption Assets (r ≈ 0)**
- **Commodities**: Storage and convenience yield important

#### Currency Forward Pricing

**Interest Rate Parity**
```
F = S × (1 + r_domestic) / (1 + r_foreign)
```

**Simplified Formula**
```
F = S × (1 + r_d × T) / (1 + r_f × T)
```

**Example: USD/INR Forward**
- **Spot USD/INR**: 83.50
- **USD Rate**: 5.25% (annual)
- **INR Rate**: 6.75% (annual)
- **30-day Forward**: 83.50 × (1.0013125) / (1.0013125) = 83.50
- **90-day Forward**: 83.50 × (1.0050625) / (1.0039375) = 83.59

## 5. Options Valuation and Pricing

### Black-Scholes Model

#### Model Assumptions

**Market Assumptions**
- **No Arbitrage**: Markets are efficient with no risk-free profits
- **Lognormal Distribution**: Stock prices follow lognormal distribution
- **Constant Volatility**: Volatility remains constant over option life
- **No Transaction Costs**: Perfect markets with zero transaction costs
- **Risk-Free Rate**: Constant risk-free rate throughout option life

**Stock Assumptions**
- **No Dividends**: Stock pays no dividends (or dividends known and constant)
- **Continuous Trading**: Stock can be traded continuously
- **Short Selling**: Short selling allowed without restrictions

#### Black-Scholes Formula

**Call Option Price**
```
C = S × N(d1) - K × e^(-r×T) × N(d2)
```

**Put Option Price**
```
P = K × e^(-r×T) × N(-d2) - S × N(-d1)
```

**Where:**
```
d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)×T] / (σ×√T)
d2 = d1 - σ×√T
N(x) = Cumulative standard normal distribution
```

#### Model Parameters

**Stock Price (S)**
- **Current Market Price**: Spot price of underlying asset
- **Time to Expiration**: Days until option expiration
- **Volatility (σ)**: Expected volatility of underlying returns
- **Risk-Free Rate (r)**: Continuously compounded risk-free rate

**Calculation Example**
- **Stock Price**: ₹1,000
- **Strike Price**: ₹1,000 (ATM call)
- **Time to Expiration**: 30 days (0.0822 years)
- **Volatility**: 25% (annual)
- **Risk-Free Rate**: 6% (annual)

**Step-by-Step Calculation**
1. **d1** = [ln(1000/1000) + (0.06 + 0.0625/2) × 0.0822] / (0.25 × √0.0822)
   d1 = [0 + (0.09125) × 0.0822] / (0.0718) = 0.1044

2. **d2** = d1 - σ×√T = 0.1044 - 0.0718 = 0.0326

3. **N(d1)** = N(0.1044) = 0.5416
   **N(d2)** = N(0.0326) = 0.5130

4. **Call Price** = 1000 × 0.5416 - 1000 × e^(-0.06×0.0822) × 0.5130
   Call Price = 541.6 - 995.0 × 0.5130 = 541.6 - 510.3 = ₹31.3

### Binomial Model

#### Model Overview

**Discretization**
- **Time Steps**: Option life divided into discrete periods
- **Price Movements**: Stock price moves up or down each period
- **Risk-Neutral**: Probability adjusted for risk-neutral valuation
- **Recursion**: Value determined through backward induction

**Single Period Binomial Model**

**Price Movements**
```
Up Movement: S × u
Down Movement: S × d
```

**Risk-Neutral Probability**
```
p = (e^(r×Δt) - d) / (u - d)
```

**Option Values**
```
Call Value = e^(-r×Δt) × [p × Cu + (1-p) × Cd]
```

#### Multi-Period Model

**Two-Period Example**
- **Initial Price**: S
- **Up Factor**: u, Down Factor**: d
