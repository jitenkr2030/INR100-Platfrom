- **Examples**: Guaranteed returns, insider tips, "secret" strategies
- **Warning**: No one can guarantee investment returns

## Red Flags to Watch For

### 🚩 **Guaranteed Returns**
- **Fraudulent claim**: "100% guaranteed returns in 30 days"
- **Reality**: All investments carry risk; higher returns = higher risk
- **Safe approach**: Be skeptical of any guaranteed return claims

### 🚩 **Pressure Tactics**
- **Fraudulent tactic**: "Act now or miss this opportunity!"
- **Reality**: Legitimate investments don't require immediate decisions
- **Safe approach**: Take time to research and think

### 🚩 **Complex Strategies**
- **Fraudulent tactic**: Using jargon to confuse investors
- **Reality**: Legitimate investments can be explained simply
- **Safe approach**: If you don't understand it, don't invest

### 🚩 **Unregistered Advisors**
- **Fraudulent claim**: "I'm a licensed financial advisor"
- **Reality**: Always verify credentials with regulatory authorities
- **Safe approach**: Check with SEBI, stock exchanges, and state regulators

### 🚩 **No Physical Address**

- **Safe approach**: Legitimate companies have verifiable physical addresses

## How Fraudsters Target Retail Investors

- **Reality**: These are usually pump-and-dump schemes

### 2. **Cold Calling**
- **Approach**: Random phone calls with investment opportunities
- **Common claims**: "We have connections" or "Secret information"
- **Reality**: Legitimate advisors don't cold call random people

### 3. **Email Scams**
- **Method**: Unsolicited emails with "hot stock tips"
- **Red flags**: Poor grammar, urgent language, unrealistic claims
- **Safe approach**: Delete suspicious emails immediately

### 4. **Fake News**
