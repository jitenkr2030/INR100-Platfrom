## Introduction: Your Money Journey Starts Here

Welcome to your financial education journey! If you're reading this, you've already taken the most important step - deciding to learn about money. This lesson will change how you see every rupee in your wallet and every transaction you make.

## What is Money?

Money is not just paper notes or metal coins. Money is a social agreement - a system that allows us to exchange value with each other efficiently.

### The Three Functions of Money

#### 1. Medium of Exchange
**What it means**: Money lets us trade goods and services without needing to find someone who wants exactly what we have.

**Example**: Instead of trading 3 eggs for 1 bread, you can sell eggs for ₹30 and buy bread for ₹30.

**Why it matters**: Without money, you'd need to find someone who wants your eggs AND has bread to trade. This is called the "double coincidence of wants" problem that money solves.

#### 2. Store of Value
**What it means**: Money holds its value over time (mostly), allowing you to save today and spend tomorrow.

**Example**: You earn ₹50,000 this month and plan to spend it next month. Money preserves that purchasing power.

**Reality check**: Money doesn't always store value perfectly due to inflation, which we'll cover in detail in Lesson 4.

#### 3. Unit of Account
**What it means**: Money gives us a common measure to compare the value of different things.

**Example**: A smartphone costs ₹25,000, a bike costs ₹80,000. The rupee helps us compare these values.

## The Evolution of Money

Money hasn't always looked like the ₹10 note in your pocket. Let's see how it evolved:

### 1. Barter System (Early Times)
**How it worked**: People traded goods directly.
- 1 cow = 2 goats
- 1 hour of carpentry = 5 kg of rice

**Problems**:
- No common measure of value
- Hard to find trading partners
- Difficult to store value
- No way to divide large items

### 2. Commodity Money (Ancient Times)
**Examples**: Salt, shells, cattle, precious metals

**Benefits**:
- More durable than perishable goods
- Everyone agreed on their value

**Problems**:
- Still bulky to carry around
- Different regions valued things differently

### 3. Metal Coins (Medieval Times)
**Examples**: Gold coins, silver coins, copper coins

**Benefits**:
- Standardized weight and purity
- Easier to carry and count
- Durable for centuries

**Problems**:
- Still heavy for large transactions
- Could be clipped or counterfeited

### 4. Paper Money (Modern Era)
**First paper money**: Chinese Song Dynasty (1000 years ago)

**Benefits**:
- Lightweight and portable
- Easy to print and distribute
- Centralized control and regulation

**The truth**: Paper money itself has little intrinsic value. It's valuable because we all agree it is.

### 5. Digital Money (Current Era)
**Examples**: Bank accounts, UPI, mobile wallets, cryptocurrency

**Benefits**:
- Instant transfers
- Lower transaction costs
- Available 24/7
- No physical storage needed

**Current reality**: Most money today exists only as digital entries in bank computers.

## How Money is Created Today

Here's the surprising truth: Most money is created by banks, not the government!

### The Money Creation Process

#### Step 1: The Central Bank (RBI)
The Reserve Bank of India creates "base money" (also called high-powered money):
- Physical currency (₹500, ₹1000 notes)
- Digital reserves for banks

#### Step 2: Commercial Banks
When you deposit ₹1,00,000 in a bank, here's what happens:
1. Bank keeps ₹10,000 as reserves (10% requirement)
2. Bank lends out ₹90,000 to someone else
3. That person deposits the ₹90,000 in their account
4. Bank keeps ₹9,000 and lends ₹81,000
5. This process continues...

#### The Magic of Fractional Reserve Banking
With just ₹1,00,000 in initial deposits, banks can create much more money:
- Original deposit: ₹1,00,000
- Money created through lending: ₹9,00,000
- Total money supply: ₹10,00,000

**This is why banking works, but it's also why financial crises can happen.**
