## EMI Calculation and Analysis

### EMI Calculation Methods

#### Standard EMI Formula
**Mathematical Formula**
- EMI = [P × r × (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
- Where:
  - P = Principal loan amount
  - r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
  - n = Number of monthly installments

#### Manual Calculation Example
**Loan Parameters**
- **Principal**: ₹50,00,000
- **Annual Interest Rate**: 8.5%
- **Monthly Rate**: 8.5% ÷ 12 = 0.7083%
- **Tenure**: 20 years (240 months)

**EMI Calculation**
- r = 0.0085 ÷ 12 = 0.000708
- n = 20 × 12 = 240
- EMI = [50,00,000 × 0.000708 × (1.000708)^240] / [(1.000708)^240 - 1]
- EMI = ₹43,249 (approximately)

### EMI Analysis Tools

#### Loan Amortization Schedule
**Principal and Interest Breakdown**
**Year 1 Analysis**:
- Total Payment: ₹43,249 × 12 = ₹5,18,988
- Interest Component: ₹4,20,000 (approximately 81%)
- Principal Component: ₹98,988 (approximately 19%)

**Year 10 Analysis**:
- Total Payment: ₹43,249 × 12 = ₹5,18,988
- Interest Component: ₹2,80,000 (approximately 54%)
- Principal Component: ₹2,38,988 (approximately 46%)

**Year 20 Analysis**:
- Total Payment: ₹43,249 × 12 = ₹5,18,988
- Interest Component: ₹35,000 (approximately 7%)
- Principal Component: ₹4,83,988 (approximately 93%)

#### Interest Payment Patterns
**Front-loaded Interest**
- **Initial Years**: Majority of EMI goes toward interest
- **Later Years**: Majority of EMI goes toward principal
- **Tax Implications**: Interest deduction decreases over time
- **Prepayment Impact**: Maximum benefit in early years

### Total Interest Cost Analysis

#### 20-Year Loan Analysis
**Loan Parameters**: ₹50 lakh at 8.5% for 20 years
- **Total EMI Paid**: ₹43,249 × 240 = ₹1,03,79,760
- **Total Interest**: ₹1,03,79,760 - ₹50,00,000 = ₹53,79,760
- **Interest as % of Principal**: 107.6%

#### Tenure Comparison
**Total Interest Cost Analysis**

| Tenure | EMI | Total Interest | Total Payment |
|--------|-----|----------------|---------------|
| **15 years** | ₹49,172 | ₹38,50,960 | ₹88,50,960 |
| **20 years** | ₹43,249 | ₹53,79,760 | ₹1,03,79,760 |
