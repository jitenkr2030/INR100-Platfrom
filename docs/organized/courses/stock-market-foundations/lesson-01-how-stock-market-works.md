## What is a Stock Market?

A stock market is a marketplace where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. Think of it as a huge marketplace where investors come together to trade ownership pieces of companies.

### Key Functions of the Stock Market:
1. **Price Discovery**: Determines the fair value of companies based on supply and demand
2. **Liquidity**: Provides a platform to easily buy and sell shares
3. **Capital Formation**: Helps companies raise money by selling shares to investors
4. **Investment Opportunities**: Allows people to invest in businesses and grow their wealth

## How Does Trading Work?

### The Basic Process:
1. **Company Goes Public**: A company decides to list its shares on a stock exchange
2. **Shares are Created**: The company creates shares representing ownership in the business
3. **Trading Begins**: Investors can now buy and sell these shares on the exchange
4. **Price Changes**: Share prices change based on company performance and market sentiment

### Simple Example:
Imagine a pizza shop that decides to sell 100 shares for ₹10,000 each:
- If the shop performs well, more people want to buy shares → Price goes up to ₹12,000
- If the shop performs poorly, people want to sell → Price drops to ₹8,000

## Indian Stock Exchanges

   - India's largest stock exchange

## Important Concepts
