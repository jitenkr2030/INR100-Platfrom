# Lesson 2: Primary Market vs. Secondary Market

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand:
- The difference between primary and secondary markets
- How companies raise money in the primary market
- How investors trade with each other in the secondary market
- Why both markets are important for the overall ecosystem

## What is the Primary Market?

The **Primary Market** is where companies sell new shares directly to investors for the first time. This is when companies raise capital to fund their business operations, expansion, or other corporate purposes.

### Key Characteristics:
- **New securities** are issued
- **Company receives the money** directly
- **One-time activity** for each new issue
- **Regulated by SEBI** (Securities and Exchange Board of India)

### Types of Primary Market Issues:

#### 1. **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**
- **Definition**: When a private company lists on stock exchange for the first time
- **Purpose**: Raise capital to grow the business
- **Example**: Zomato IPO 2021, Paytm IPO 2021

#### 2. **FPO (Follow-on Public Offering)**
- **Definition**: When an already listed company issues additional shares
- **Purpose**: Raise more capital for expansion or reduce debt
- **Example**: SBI Cards IPO 2020 (already listed SBI issuing new shares)

#### 3. **Rights Issue**
- **Definition**: Existing shareholders get priority to buy new shares
- **Price**: Usually lower than market price
- **Ratio**: Often in 1:2 or 1:3 ratio (1 new share for every 2-3 old shares)

#### 4. **Bonus Issue**
- **Definition**: Free shares given to existing shareholders
- **Purpose**: Reward shareholders without raising money
- **Example**: If you have 100 shares, you might get 50 bonus shares

#### 5. **Warrants**
- **Definition**: Gives right to buy shares at a fixed price in future
- **Similar to options**: But issued by companies, not exchanges

## How Primary Market Works

### IPO Process Step-by-Step:

#### Step 1: Company Decides to Go Public
- Board of directors approves
- Hire investment bankers
- Prepare legal documentation

#### Step 2: Due Diligence & Documentation
- Company financials are audited
- Prospectus prepared (detailed company information)
- Filed with SEBI for approval

#### Step 3: Pricing & Marketing
- Price band fixed (₹xxx to ₹xxx per share)
- Roadshows conducted (presentations to investors)
- Media coverage and marketing

#### Step 4: Subscription Period
- **Duration**: Usually 3-5 days
- **Types of Orders**:
  - **Retail Individual Investors (RII)**: Up to ₹2 lakh investment
  - **Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB)**: Mutual funds, FIIs
  - **Non-Institutional Investors**: High net worth individuals

#### Step 5: Allotment & Listing
- Shares allocated based on demand
- Shares credited to demat accounts
- Trading begins on stock exchange

### Real Example: **Zomato IPO 2021**

**Company**: Zomato Ltd.
**Issue Size**: ₹9,375 crores
**Price Band**: ₹72-₹76 per share
**Subscription**: 38.25 times oversubscribed
**Opening**: July 14, 2021
**Closing**: July 16, 2021
**Listing**: July 23, 2021

This shows the massive investor interest when a quality company goes public.

## What is the Secondary Market?

The **Secondary Market** is where investors buy and sell existing shares among themselves. Once shares are listed, they trade daily between investors on stock exchanges.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Existing securities** are traded
- **Money goes between investors**, not to the company
- **Continuous trading** during market hours
- **Price determined by supply and demand**

### How Secondary Market Works:

#### 1. **Order Placement**
- Investor places buy/sell order through broker
- Order includes: Quantity, Price, Type (market/limit)

#### 2. **Order Matching**
- Exchange matches buy and sell orders
- Price determined by highest bid and lowest ask

#### 3. **Trade Execution**
- Order gets executed when price matches
- Shares transferred from seller's to buyer's demat account
- Settlement happens T+2 (Trade + 2 days)

#### 4. **Price Discovery**
- Real-time price updates throughout the day
- Based on company news, performance, market sentiment

### Example: Daily Trading in **TCS**

- **9:15 AM**: TCS opens at ₹3,200
- **10:30 AM**: Good quarterly results announced → Price rises to ₹3,250
- **12:00 PM**: Some profit booking → Price drops to ₹3,220
- **2:00 PM**: Market sentiment improves → Price rises to ₹3,240
- **3:30 PM**: Market closes at ₹3,235

This shows how secondary market prices fluctuate based on various factors.
