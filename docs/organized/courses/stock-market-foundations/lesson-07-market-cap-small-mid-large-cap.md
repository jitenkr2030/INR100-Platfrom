## What is Market Capitalization?

**Market Capitalization (Market Cap)** is the total value of a company's outstanding shares in the stock market. It represents what the entire company is worth based on its current stock price.

### Market Cap Formula:
```
Market Capitalization = Current Share Price × Total Outstanding Shares
```

### Simple Example:
- **Company**: ABC Ltd.
- **Share Price**: ₹100
- **Outstanding Shares**: 10 crore shares
- **Market Cap**: ₹100 × 10,00,00,000 = ₹1,000 crore

### Real Example: **Reliance Industries (2024)**
- **Share Price**: ₹2,500
- **Outstanding Shares**: 676 crore shares
